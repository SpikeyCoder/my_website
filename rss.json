      "summary": "Nvidia was only invited to invest. That is one reversal of commitment. Remember that graph that has been circling around for some time now? The one that shows the circular investment from AI companies: Basically Nvidia will invest $100 billion in OpenAI. OpenAI will then invest $300 billion in Oracle, then Oracle invests back into Nvidia. Now, Jensen Huang, the Nvidia CEO, is back tracking and saying he never made that commitment . “It was never a commitment. They invited us to invest up to $100 billion and of course, we were, we were very happy and honored that they invited us, but we will invest one step at a time.” So he never committed? Did we make up all these graphs in our head? Was it a misquote from a journalist somewhere that sparkled all this frenzy? Well, you can take a look in OpenAI press release in September of 2025 . They wrote: NVIDIA intends to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as the new NVIDIA systems are deployed. In fact, Jensen Huang went on to say: “NVIDIA and OpenAI have pushed each other for a decade, from the first DGX supercomputer to the breakthrough of ChatGPT. This investment and infrastructure partnership mark the next leap forward—deploying 10 gigawatts to power the next era of intelligence.” It sounds like Jensen is distancing himself from that $100 billion commitment. Did he take a peak inside OpenAI and change his mind? At the same time, OpenAI is experimenting with ads. Sam Altman stated before that they would only ever use ads as a last resort. It sounds like we are in the phase.",

Looking around, and given that the high level idea is clear, there are a lot of smaller Claws starting to pop out. For example, on a quick skim NanoClaw looks really interesting in that the core engine is ~4000 lines of code (fits into both my head and that of AI agents, so it feels manageable, auditable, flexible, etc.) and runs everything in containers by default. [...] Anyway there are many others - e.g. nanobot, zeroclaw, ironclaw, picoclaw (lol @ prefixes). [...] Not 100% sure what my setup ends up looking like just yet but Claws are an awesome, exciting new layer of the AI stack. Andrej has an ear for fresh terminology (see vibe coding , agentic engineering ) and I think he's right about this one, too: \" Claw \" is becoming a term of art for the entire category of OpenClaw-like agent systems - AI agents that generally run on personal hardware, communicate via messaging protocols and can both act on direct instructions and schedule tasks.

      "summary": "I've been wanting to add indications of my various other online activities to my blog for a while now. I just turned on a new feature I'm calling \"beats\" (after story beats, naming this was hard!) which adds five new types of content to my site, all corresponding to activity elsewhere. Here's what beats look like: Those three are from the 30th December 2025 archive page. Beats are little inline links with badges that fit into different content timeline views around my site, including the homepage, search and archive pages. There are currently five types of beats: Releases are GitHub releases of my many different open source projects, imported from this JSON file that was constructed by GitHub Actions . TILs are the posts from my TIL blog , imported using a SQL query over JSON and HTTP against the Datasette instance powering that site. Museums are new posts on my niche-museums.com blog, imported from this custom JSON feed . Tools are HTML and JavaScript tools I've vibe-coded on my tools.simonwillison.net site, as described in Useful patterns for building HTML tools . Research is for AI-generated research projects, hosted in my simonw/research repo and described in Code research projects with async coding agents like Claude Code and Codex . That's five different custom integrations to pull in all of that data. The good news is that this kind of integration project is the kind of thing that coding agents really excel at. I knocked most of the feature out in a single morning while working in parallel on various other things. I didn't have a useful structured feed of my Research projects, and it didn't matter because I gave Claude Code a link to the raw Markdown README that lists them all and it spun up a parser regex . Since I'm responsible for both the source and the destination I'm fine with a brittle solution that would be too risky against a source that I don't control myself. Claude also handled all of the potentially tedious UI integration work with my site, making sure the new content worked on all of my different page types and was handled correctly by my faceted search engine . Prototyping with Claude Artifacts I actually prototyped the initial concept for beats in regular Claude - not Claude Code - taking advantage of the fact that it can clone public repos from GitHub these days. I started with: Clone simonw/simonwillisonblog and tell me about the models and views And then later in the brainstorming session said: use the templates and CSS in this repo to create a new artifact with all HTML and CSS inline that shows me my homepage with some of those inline content types mixed in After some iteration we got to this artifact mockup , which was enough to convince me that the concept had legs and was worth handing over to full Claude Code for web to implement. If you want to see how the rest of the build played out the most interesting PRs are Beats #592 which implemented the core feature and Add Museums Beat importer #595 which added the Museums content type.

Object permanence: Social media turned US parties into host organisms for third parties; \"Citizens\" are hired actors; Insured exoskeletons; Talking with Snowden and Gibson. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. A perforated corporate veil (permalink) \"Capitalist realism\" is the idea that the world's current economic and political arrangements are inevitable, and that any attempt to alter them is a) irrational; b) doomed; and c) dangerous. It's the ideology of Margaret Thatcher's maxim, \"There is no alternative.\" Obviously this is very convenient if you are a current beneficiary of the status quo. \"There is no alternative\" is a thought-stopping demand dressed up as an observation. It means, \"Don't try and think of alternatives.\" The thing is, alternatives already exist and work very well. The Mondragon co-ops in Spain constitute a fully worked out, long-term stable economic alternative to traditional capitalist enterprises, employing more than 100,000 people and generating tangible, empirically measured benefits to workers, customers and the region: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation Proponents of capitalist realism will tell you that Mondragon doesn't count. Maybe it's just a one-off. Or maybe it's just not big enough. 100,000 workers sounds like a lot, but Amazon has over 1.5m employees and untold numbers of misclassified contractors who are employees in everything but name (and legal rights). This is some pretty transparent goalpost moving, but sure, let's stipulate that Mondragon doesn't prove that there are broadly applicable alternatives to the dominant capitalism of the mid-2020s. Are there other examples of \"an alternative?\" There sure are. Let's look at limited liability. Limited liability – the idea that a company's shareholders cannot be held liable for the company's misdeeds – is a bedrock of capitalist dogma. The story goes that until the advent of the \"joint stock enterprise\" (and its handmaiden, limited liability) there was no efficient way to do \"capital formation\" (raising money for a project or business). Because of this, the only ambitious, capital-intensive projects were those that caught the fancy of a king, a Pope, or an aristocrat. But once limited liability appears on the scene, many people of modest means can jointly invest in a project without worrying about being bankrupted if it turns out that the people running it are crooks or bumblers. That lets you, say, buy a single share of a company without having to keep daily tabs on the management's every action without worrying that if they go wrong, someone they've hurt will sue you for everything you've got. Capital formation is a real thing, and limited liability unquestionably facilitates capital formation. There are plenty of good things in the world that exist because limited liability protections allowed everyday people to help bring them into existence. This isn't just stuff that makes a lot of money for capitalism's true believers, it includes everything from the company that makes the printing presses that your favorite anarchist zine runs on to the mill that makes the alloys for the e-bike you use to get to a demonstration. This is where capitalist realism comes in. Capitalist realists will claim that there is no way to do capital formation for these beneficial goods without limited liability – and not just any limited liability, but maximum limited liability in which the \"corporate veil\" can never be pierced to assign culpability to any shareholder. The capitalist realist claim is that the corporate veil is like the skin of a balloon, and that any attempt to poke even the smallest hole in it will cause it to rupture and vanish. But this just isn't true, and we can tell, because one of the largest economies in the world has operated with a perforated corporate veil for nearly a century, and that economy hasn't suffered from capital formation problems. Quite the contrary, some of the world's largest (and most destructive) monopolies are headquartered in this country where the veil of limited liability is thoroughly perforated. The country I'm talking about is Brazil, which has had limited limited liability since 1937: https://lpeproject.org/blog/when-workers-pierce-the-corporate-veil-brazils-forgotten-innovation/ As Mariana Pargendler writes for the LPE Project, Brazil put limits on limited liability to address a common pattern of corporate abuse. Companies would set up in Brazil, incur a lot of liabilities (say, by poisoning the land, water and air, or by stealing from or maiming workers), and then, when the wheels of justice caught up with them, the companies would fold and re-establish themselves the next day under a new name. Like I say, this happens all over the world. It's incredibly common, and even the pettiest of crooks know how to use this trick. I know someone whose NYC apartment was flooded by the upstairs neighbor, who decided that they didn't need to worry about the fact that their toilet wouldn't stop running – for months, until the walls of the apartment downstairs dissolved in a slurry of black mold. The upstairs neighbor owned the apartment through an LLC, which they simply folded up and walked away from, while my friend was stuck with a giant bill and no one to sue. The limited liability company is the scammer's best friend. In the UK, an anti-tax extremist invented a tax-evasion scam whereby landlords pretend that their empty commercial buildings are tax-exempt \"snail farms\" by scattering around some boxes with a few snails in them: https://www.patreon.com/posts/149255928?collection=1941093 When this results in inevitable stonking fines and adverse judgments, the \"snail farmers\" duck liability by folding up their limited liability company after transferring its assets to a new LLC. Capitalist realists will tell you that this is just the price of efficient capital formation. Without total, airtight limited liability – the sort that allows for this kind of obvious, petty ripoff – no one would be able to raise capital for anything. Brazil begs to differ. In 1937, Brazil made parent companies liable for their subsidiaries' obligations, with a system of \"joint and several liability\" for LLCs. This was expanded with 1943's Consolidation of Labor Laws, and it worked so well that the Brazilian legislature expanded it again in 2017. Remember back in 2024, when Elon Musk defied a Brazilian court order about Twitter, only to have Brazil freeze Starlink's assets until Musk caved? That was the \"joint and several\" liability system: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/world/americas/brazil-musk-x-starlink.html As Pargendler writes, Brazil's liability system \"represented a distributive choice: prioritizing Brazilian workers’ ability to enforce their rights over foreign capital’s interest in minimizing costs through corporate structuring.\" Pargendler (who teaches at Harvard Law) co-authored a paper with São Paulo Law's Olívia Pasqualeto analyzing the impact that Brazil's limited liability system had on capital formation and corporate conduct: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=6105586 Unsurprisingly, they find that there has been a steady pressure to erode the joint and several system, but also that some countries (the US and France) have a \"joint employer\" doctrine that is a weak form of this. Portugal, meanwhile, adopted the Brazilian system, 70 years after Brazil – this transposition of law from a former colony to a former colonial power is apparently called \"reverse convergence\": https://lpeproject.org/blog/heterodox-corporate-laws-in-the-global-south/ More countries in the global south have adopted regimes similar to Brazil's, like Venezuela and Chile. Other countries go further, like Mozambique and Angola. Somewhere in between are other Latin American countries like Peru and Uruguay, where these rules have entered practice through judicial rulings, not legislation. The authors don't claim that perforating the corporate veil solves all the problems of exploitative, fraudulent or corrupt corporate conduct. Rather, they're challenging the capitalist realist doctrine that insists that this system couldn't possibly exist, and if it did, it would be a disaster.

      "summary": "A few years back, the term \"AI\" took an unexpected turn when it was redefined as \"Actual Indian\". As in, a person in India operating the machine remotely. I first heard the term when Amazon was boasting about their cashierless grocery stores. There was a big sign in the store that said \"Just Walk Out,\" meaning you grab your items, walk out, and get charged the correct amount automatically. How did they do it? According to Amazon, they used AI. What kind of AI exactly, nobody was quite sure. But customers started reporting something odd. They weren't charged immediately after leaving the store. Some said it took several days for a charge to appear on their account. It eventually came out that the technology was sophisticated tracking performed by Amazon's team in India. Workers would manually review footage of each customer's visit and charge them accordingly. What's fascinating is that this operation was impressive. Coordinating thousands of store visits, matching items to customers across multiple camera angles, and doing it accurately enough that most people never noticed the delay. But because it was buried under the \"AI\" label, the moment the truth came out, the whole thing became a punchline. In 2024, Tesla held their \"We, Robot\" event, where Optimus robots operated a bar. They were serving drinks, dancing, and mingling with guests. It was a pretty impressive display. The robots moved fluidly, held conversations, and handed off drinks without fumbling. Elon Musk claimed they were AI-driven , fully autonomous. People were genuinely impressed by the interactions, and for good reason. Fluid, bipedal locomotion in a crowded social environment is an extraordinarily hard robotics problem. The moment it came out that the robots were teleoperated, the sentiment flipped entirely. It didn't matter how dexterous or natural the movement was. It felt like a magic trick exposed. But think about what was actually being demonstrated. Humanoid robots walking through a crowd, responding in real time to a human operator's inputs, without tripping over guests or spilling drinks. That's not nothing. Slapping \"AI\" on it turned an engineering achievement into a scandal. More recently, the company 1X unveiled a friendly humanoid robot available for purchase at $20,000. The demo looks genuinely impressive. The robot can perform domestic tasks like doing laundry, folding clothes, and navigating a home environment. And if it doesn't know how to do something, it can be taught. You can authorize a remote worker to take control, demonstrate the task, and the robot learns from that demonstration, adding it to its growing repertoire. That's a legitimately interesting approach to machine learning through human guidance. What got glossed over is how much of the current capability relies on that remote worker. Right after the unveiling, the Wall Street Journal was invited to test the robots. In their video, the robot is being operated entirely by a person sitting in the next room. To be fair, the smoothness of that teleoperation is itself a technical achievement. Real-time control of a bipedal robot performing fine motor tasks, like folding a shirt, requires low-latency communication, precise motor control, and a well-designed interface for the operator. That's years of engineering work. But because teleoperation isn't the product being sold, AI is,that achievement gets treated as evidence of fraud rather than progress. We've built an environment where \"teleoperated\" has become a slur, and anything short of full autonomy is seen as cheating. Even Waymo, whose self-driving cars have logged millions of autonomous miles, feels compelled to publicly defend themselves against accusations of secretly using remote operators. As if any human involvement would invalidate everything they've built. I think teleoperation is pretty impressive. It's a valuable technology in its own right. Surgeons use it to operate across continents. Industrial operators use it to work in places no human could safely go. In all of these cases, having a human-in-the-loop is the point. Every \"AI\" product that turns out to have a person behind the curtain makes the public more skeptical. In a parallel universe, there is a version of the tech industry that celebrates teleoperation as a stepping stone. Where we are building tools to make collaboration easier through teleoperation, and it's not viewed as an embarrassing secret.",

      "summary": "Today's links Six years of Pluralistic: Time flies when you're writing the web. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: MBA phrenology; Sony's DRM CEO is out; Midwestern Tahrir; Reverse Centaurs and AI. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Six years of Pluralistic (permalink) Six years ago today, after 19 years with Boing Boing, during which time I wrote tens of thousands of blog posts, I started a new, solo blog, with the semi-ironic name \"Pluralistic.\" I didn't know what Pluralistic was going to be, but I wasn't writing Boing Boing anymore, and I knew I wanted to keep writing the web in some fashion. Six years and more than 1,500 posts later, I am so satisfied with how Pluralistic is going. I spent a couple of decades processing everything that seemed interesting or significant through a blog, which created a massive database (and mnemonically available collection of partially developed thoughts) that I'm now reprocessing as a series of essays that make sense of today in light of everything that I've thought about for my whole adult life, which are, in turn, fodder for books, both fiction and nonfiction. I call this \"The Memex Method\": https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/09/the-memex-method/ \"The Memex Method\" is also the title of a collection of essays (from this blog) that I've sold to Farrar, Straus and Giroux, but that book keeps getting bumped because of other books I end up writing based on the work I do here, starting with last year's Enshittification. I'm now fully two books ahead of myself, with The Reverse Centaur's Guide to Life After AI coming in June, and The Post-American Internet in early 2027 (in addition to two graphic novels and a short story collection). Professionally speaking, these are the most successful books I've written, in a long, 30+ book career with many notable successes. Intellectually and artistically speaking, I'm incredibly satisfied with the direction my career has moved in over my six Pluralistic years. Blogging is – and always has been – a lot of work for me, but it's work that pays off, even if I don't always know what form that payoff will take. One essential part of this blog is my daily retrospective of posts from this day through my blogging history – 25 years ago, 20 years ago, 15 years ago, 10 years ago, 5 years ago, and last year. I used to call this \"This day in history\" but now I call it \"Object permanence,\" for the developmental milestone when toddlers gain the ability to remember and reason about things that have recently happened (roughly, it's the point at which \"peek-a-boo\" stops being fun). The daily business of reviewing and selecting blog posts from different parts of my life started as a trivial exercise, but it's become one of the most important things I do. I liken it to working dough and folding the dry crumbly edges back into the center; in this case, I'm folding all the fragments that are in danger of escaping my working memory back into the center of my attention. Six years ago, I didn't know what Pluralistic was going to be. Today, I still don't know. But because this is a labor of love, and a solo project, I get to try anything and either give it up or carry it on based on how it makes me feel and what effect it has on my life. I'm always tinkering with the format: this year, I also added a subhead to the Object Permanence section that tries to call out (in as few characters as possible) the most important elements of the day's list. I also dropped some things this year, notably, my \"linkdump\" posts. A couple years ago, at the suggestion of Mitch Wagner, I added a new section called \"Hey look at this,\" which featured three bare links to things I thought were noteworthy but didn't have time or inclination to delve into in depth. Later, I expanded this section to five. However, even with five bare links per edition, I often found myself with a backlog of noteworthy things. So I started writing the occasional Saturday \"linkdump\" essay in which I wove together the whole backlog into a giant, meandering essay. These made for interesting rhetorical challenges, as I found elegant ways to bridge completely disparate subjects – a kind of collaging, perhaps akin to how a mashup artist mixes two very different tracks together. Mentally, I thought of this as \"ringing the changes,\" but ultimately, I decided to drop these linkdump posts (for now, at least). They ended up being too much work, and of little value to me, because I found myself unable to remember what I wrote in them and thus to call them up to refer to them for future posts. Here's all 33 linkdumps; they're not gone forever (not so long as the links pile up in my backlog), but when they come back, they'll be in a different form: https://pluralistic.net/tag/linkdump/ This really is a labor of love, in the sense that I love doing it, and because it's hard work. The fact that it's hard work is a feature, not a bug. Working hard on stuff is really important to me, because when I am working hard, I gain respite from both physical and mental discomfort. As a guy with serious chronic pain living through the Trump years, I've got plenty of both kinds of discomfort. I can't overstate how physically and mentally beneficial it is to me to have an activity that takes me out of the moment. This year, I wrote several editions of Pluralistic from an infusion couch at the Kaiser Sunset hematology center in LA, where I was receiving immunotherapy for a cancer diagnosis that I'm assured is very treatable, but which – to be totally honest – sometimes gets my old worrier running hot: https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/05/carcinoma-angels/#squeaky-nail Making Pluralistic is several kinds of hard work. Over the past six years, I've become an ardent collagist, spending more and more time on the weird, semi-grotesque images that run atop every edition. Anything you devote substantial time to on a near-daily basis is something that gives you insight – into yourself, and into the thing you're doing. I've always had a certain familiarity with computer image editing (I think I got my start writing Apple ][+ BASIC programs that spat out ASCII art, before graduating to making pixel-art for Broderbund's \"Print Shop\"), but I've never applied myself to any visual field in a serious way, until now. Amazingly, after 50 years of thinking of myself as someone who is \"bad at visual art,\" I find myself identifying as a visual artist. I find myself pondering visual works the same way I think about prose – mentally tearing it apart to unpick how it is done, and thinking about how I could productively steal some new techniques for my own work. I'm also privileged to have some accomplished visual artists in my circle, like my pal Alistair Milne, who generously share technical and aesthetic tips. It's got to the point where I published a book of my art, and I think I'll probably do it again next year: https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/04/illustrious/#chairman-bruce There's also a ton of technical work that goes into publishing each edition of this newsletter. Things have moved on somewhat since I published an in-depth process-post in 2021, though I'm still totally reliant on Loren Kohnfelder's python scripts that help me turn the XML file I compose every day into files that are (nearly) ready to publish: https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/13/two-decades/#hfbd Much of the technical work is down to the fact that I'm still completely wed to the idea of \"POSSE\" (Post Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere): https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/19/now-we-are-two/#two-much-posse This means that after I write the day's post, I reformat it and republish it as a text-only newsletter, a Medium post, a Tumblr post, a Twitter thread and a Mastodon thread. This involves a ton of manual work, because none of the services I post to are designed to facilitate this, so I'm always wrestling with them. This year, all of them got worse (incredibly). Medium – where I used to have a paid column – has dropped its free-flag for my account, which now limits me to how many posts I can schedule. This doesn't come up often, but when I do schedule a post, it's generally because I'm going to be on a plane or a stage and won't be able to do it manually. There's no way I'm going to pay for this feature: I'm happy to give Medium my work gratis, but I will not and do not pay anyone to publish my work, and I never will. Tumblr did something to its post-composing text editor that completely broke it and I've given up on fixing it. I can't even type into a new post field! I have to paste in some styled text, then delete it, then start typing. It's ghastly. So now I just have a text file full of formatted HTML snippets and I work exclusively in the Tumblr HTML editor, pasting in blobs of preformatted HTML (including the florid, verbose HTML Tumblr uses for its own formatting) and then laboriously flip back and forth to the \"visual\" editor to see the parts that went wrong. Here's how busted that visual editor is: searching for a word then double-clicking on it does not select it. You have to click once, wait about 1.5 seconds, click again, wait again, and then you can select the word. Twitter has entered a period of terminal technical decline. I know, I know, we always talk about how fucked Twitter's content moderation is, for obvious and good reasons, but from a technical perspective, Twitter just sucks. If I make a post with an image and alt text in anticipation of later using it to start a thread, it often goes \"stale\" and will not publish until I delete the image and re-attach it and re-paste the alt text. Meanwhile, the thread editor is also decaying into uselessness. Fill in a 25-post thread and hit publish and, the majority of times, the thread publication will die midway through, displaying lots of weird failure modes (phantom empty posts at the end of the thread that need to be individually selected and deleted are a common one, but not the only one). The old Twitter's ability to add a new thread to an existing one has been dead for at least a year, so every post after the 25th stanza has to be manually tacked on to the previous one, which is made far harder by the fact that Twitter no longer reliably shows you the post you just made after it publishes. Mastodon still lacks a decent thread editor, one that has even the minimal functionality of Twitter circa 2020. Meanwhile, the Fediverse HOA continues to surface from time to time, with someone who's had a Masto account for ten seconds scolding me for posting threads – from my account whose bio starts \"I post long threads.\" It's genuinely tedious to be shouted at for \"using Mastodon wrong\" by someone who started using Mastodon yesterday (I opened my first Mastodon account in 2018!), and even worse when they double down after I point them to the essay I've written to explain why I post the way I do, and what to do if you want to read my work somewhere that's not your Mastodon timeline (\"Can you believe this asshole wrote a whole essay to explain why he posts his stupid Mastodon threads?\"): https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/16/how-to-make-the-least-worst-mastodon-threads/ Then there's email: I continue to love email, but email doesn't love me back. After years of being blackholed by AT&T and then Google, this turns out to be the year that Microsoft bounces thousands of messages to its Hotmail and Outlook users because they have arbitrarily and without warning added my mail-server to a blacklist. Thank you to the Fediverse friends who escalated my trouble ticket – but man, this is a headache I could certainly do without: https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/10/dead-letters/ My sysadmin, the incomparable and tireless Ken Snider, tells me that he's got the long-overdue new hardware installed at the colo and he's nearly ready to stand up my long-anticipated personal Mastodon server, which will let me solve all kinds of problems. He's also going to stand up my own Bluesky server, at which point I will part ways with Twitter. I wish I could have used the regular Bluesky service while I waited, but just setting up an account permanently binds you to totally unacceptable and dangerous terms of service: https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/15/dogs-breakfast/#by-clicking-this-you-agree-on-behalf-of-your-employer-to-release-me-from-all-obligations-and-waivers-arising-from-any-and-all-NON-NEGOTIATED-agreements What's the point of a service that has account- and data-portability if signing up for it makes you permanently surrender your rights, even if you switch servers? This might be the stupidest social media unforced error of the post-zuckermuskian era. There is one technology that has made my POSSE life better, and it might surprise you. This year, I installed Ollama – an open-source LLM – on my laptop. It runs pretty well, even without a GPU. Every day, before I run Loren's python publication scripts, I run the text through Ollama as a typo-catcher (my prompt is \"find typos\"). Ollama always spots three or four of these, usually stuff like missing punctuation, or forgotten words, or double words (\"the the next thing\") or typos that are still valid words (\"of top of everything else\"). The reason this is so valuable to me is that errors magnify through each stage of POSSE. Errors that make it through the python publication script take 10x the time to fix that they would if I caught them beforehand. Errors that I catch after running the scripts and publishing the posts take 10x time more. Errors that I have to fix later on – once I've closed all the relevant tabs and editors – take 10x again more time. Some POSSE channels (email, Twitter) can't be fixed at all. So catching these typos at the start of the process is a huge time-saver. I have some very generous readers who have the proofreader's gene and are very helpful in catching my typos (hi, Gregory and 9o6!), and I feel bad about depriving them of their fun, but there's still the odd error that slips through, and they always catch it. Ollama is a pretty good typo-catcher. Probably half of the \"errors\" it points out are false positives, which is better than the false positive rate for Google Docs' grammar-checker. As someone who uses a lot of jargon, made up words, etc in his prose, I'm used to overriding my text-editor. I wouldn't simply trust an LLM's edits any more than I would accept every suggestion from a spell-checker. Hell, yesterday I sent back a professionally copyedited manuscript (the intro for the paperback of Enshittification) and marked \"STET\" on about a third of the queries. Doubtless some of you are affronted by my modest use of an LLM. You think that LLMs are \"fruits of the poisoned tree\" and must be eschewed because they are saturated with the sin of their origins. I think this is a very bad take, the kind of rathole that purity culture always ends up in. Let's start with some context. If you don't want to use technology that was created under immoral circumstances or that sprang from an immoral mind, then you are totally fucked. I mean, all the way down to the silicon chips in your device, which can never be fully disentangled from the odious, paranoid racist William Shockley, who won the Nobel Prize for co-inventing the silicon transistor: https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/24/the-traitorous-eight-and-the-battle-of-germanium-valley/ Further, we wouldn't have the packet-switched network that delivered these words to you without the contributions of the literal war-criminals at the RAND corporation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET Refusing to use a technology because the people who developed it were indefensible creeps is a self-owning dead-end. You know what's better than refusing to use a technology because you hate its creators? Seizing that technology and making it your own. Don't like the fact that a convicted monopolist has a death-grip on networking? Steal its protocol, release a free software version of it, and leave it in your dust: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/samba-versus-smb-adversarial-interoperability-judo-network-effects That's how we make good tech: not by insisting that all its inputs be free from sin, but by purging that wickedness by liberating the technology from its monstrous forebears and making free and open versions of it: https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/14/contesting-popularity/#everybody-samba Purity culture is such an obvious trap, an artifact of the neoliberal ideology that insists that the solution to all our problems is to shop very carefully, thus reducing all politics to personal consumption choices: https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/31/unsatisfying-answers/#systemic-problems I mean, it was extraordinarily stupid for the Nazis to refuse Einstein's work because it was \"Jewish science,\" but not merely because antisemitism is stupid. It was also a major self-limiting move because Einstein was right: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-2-pro-nazi-nobelists-attacked-einstein-s-jewish-science-excerpt1/ Refusing to run an LLM on your laptop because you don't like Sam Altman is as foolish as refusing to get monoclonal antibodies because James Watson was a racist nutjob: https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/07/james-watson-remembrance-from-dna-pioneer-to-pariah/ Or to refuse to communicate via satellite because they were launched into space on a descendant of a rocket designed by the Nazi Wernher von Braun and built by slaves in a death camp: https://wsmrmuseum.com/2020/07/27/von-braun-the-v-2-and-slave-labor/4/ The AI bubble sucks. AI itself is a normal technology: https://knightcolumbia.org/content/ai-as-normal-technology It's not \"unethical\" to scrape the web in order to create and analyze data-sets. That's just \"a search engine\": https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/17/how-to-think-about-scraping/ There's plenty of useful things people can do with AI. There's plenty of useful things people will do with AI. AI is bad because it's an economic bubble and a grift, but not because we've created a bunch of utilities that would – under normal circumstances – be called \"plug-ins\": https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/05/pop-that-bubble/#u-washington I started blogging 25 years ago, just before the dotcom bubble popped. That bubble-pop inflicted a lot of pain on people who didn't deserve it, including the normie investors who'd been suckered into blowing their life's savings on dogshit stocks, and everyday workers who found themselves out of a job. But the world was better off. So was the web. With the bubble popped, real, good stuff could access talent, servers and office space. In the six years I've been doing this, I've seen several bubbles come and go: crypto, web3, metaverse. Now it's AI. But those bubbles were like Enron, frauds that left nothing good behind. AI is like the dotcom bubble, awash in sin and inflicting untold misery, but it will leave something useful behind: https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/19/bubblenomics/#pop And when it does, I'll make sense of it on this blog.

      "summary": "How did we do it before ChatGPT? How did we write full sentences, connect ideas into a coherent arc, solve problems that had no obvious answer? We thought. That's it. We simply sat with discomfort long enough for something to emerge. I find this fascinating. You have a problem, so you sit down and think until you find a solution. Sometimes you're not even sitting down. You go for a walk, and your mind quietly wrestles with the idea while your feet carry you nowhere in particular. A solution emerges not because you forced it, but because you thought it through. What happened in that moment is remarkable: new information was created from the collision of existing ideas inside your head. No prompt. No query. Just you. I remember the hours I used to spend debugging a particularly stubborn problem at work. I would stare at the screen, type a few keystrokes, then delete them. I'd meet with our lead engineer and we would talk in circles. At home, I would lie in bed still turning the problem over. And then one night, somewhere around 3 a.m., I dreamt I was running the compiler, making a small change, watching it build, and suddenly it worked. I woke up knowing the answer before I had even tested it. I had to wait until morning to confirm what my sleeping mind had already solved. That's the mind doing what it was built to do. Writers know this feeling too. A sentence that won't cooperate in the afternoon sometimes writes itself during a morning shower. Scientists have described waking up with the solution to a problem they fell asleep wrestling with. Mendeleev wrote in his dairy that he saw the periodic table in a dream . The mind that keeps working when we stop forcing it. The mind can generate new ideas from its own reflection, something we routinely accuse large language models of being incapable of. LLMs recombine what already exists; the human mind makes unexpected leaps. But increasingly, it feels as though we are outsourcing those leaps before we ever attempt them. Why sit with a half-formed thought when you can just ask? Why let an idea marinate when a tool can hand you something polished in seconds? if (Math.random() > .4) { take_a_leap() } I won't say that AI is making us lazy, because it isn't laziness to reach for the calculator to do long divisions. However, we are slowly forgetting what it felt like to think hard. And soon we will stop believing that we are capable of it. Thinking improves thinking. The mind is like any muscle. Leave it unstrained and it weakens. Push it and it grows. The best ideas you will ever have are still inside you, waiting for the particular silence that only comes when you stop reaching for your phone. In the age of AI, the most radical thing you can do might simply be to think.",

For example, if you want to work, but can't find a job, then the minimum wage you'll get is zero: https://web.archive.org/web/20200625043843/https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2020-06-24/forget-ubi-says-an-economist-its-time-for-universal-basic-jobs That's why politicians like Avi Lewis (who is running for leader of Canada's New Democratic Party) has called for a jobs guarantee: a government guarantee of a good job at a socially inclusive wage for everyone who wants one: https://lewisforleader.ca/ideas/dignified-work-full-plan (Disclosure: I have advised the Lewis campaign on technical issues and I have endorsed his candidacy.) If that sounds Utopian or Communist to you (or both), consider this: it was the American jobs guarantee that delivered America's system of national parks, among many other achievements: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_Conservation_Corps The idea of a wage for everyone who wants a job is just one interesting question raised by the concept of a \"minimum wage.\" Even when we're talking about people who have wages, the idea of a \"minimum wage\" is anything but straightforward. Take gig workers: the rise of Uber and its successors created an ever-expanding class of workers who are misclassified as independent contractors by employers, seeking to evade unionization, benefits and liability. It's a weird kind of \"independent contractor\" who gets punished for saying no to lowball offers, has to decorate their personal clothes and/or cars in their \"client's\" livery, and who has every movement scripted by an app controlled by their \"client\": https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/02/upward-redistribution/ The pretext that a worker is actually a standalone small business confers another great advantage on their employers: it's a great boon to any boss who wants to steal their worker's wages. I'm not talking about stealing tips here (though gig-work platforms do steal tips, like crazy): https://www.nyc.gov/mayors-office/news/2026/01/mayor-mamdani-announces–5-million-settlement–reinstatement-of- I'm talking about how gig-work platforms define their workers' wages in the first place. This is a very salient definition in public policy debates. Gig platforms facing regulation or investigation routinely claim that their workers are paid sky-high wages. During the debate over California's Prop 22 (in which Uber and Lyft spent more than $225m to formalize worker misclassification), gig companies agreed to all kinds of reasonable-sounding wage guarantees: https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/14/final_ver2/#prop-22 When Toronto was grappling with the brutal effect that gig-work taxis have on the city's world-beatingly bad traffic, Uber promised to pay its drivers \"120% of the minimum wage,\" which would come out to $21.12 per hour. However, the real wage Uber was proposing to pay its drivers came out to about $2.50 per hour: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/29/geometry-hates-uber/#toronto-the-gullible How to explain the difference? Well, Uber – and its gig-work competitors – only pay drivers while they have a passenger – or an item – in the car. Drivers are not paid for the time they spend waiting for a job or the time they spend getting to the job. This is the majority of time that a gig driver spends working for the platform, and by excluding the majority of time a driver is on the clock, the company can claim to pay a generous wage while actually paying peanuts. Now, at this phase, you may be thinking that this is only fair, or at least traditional. Livery cab drivers don't get paid unless they have a fare in the cab, right? That's true, but livery cab drivers have lots of ways to influence that number. They can shrewdly choose a good spot to cruise. They can give their cellphone numbers to riders they've established a rapport with in order to win advance bookings. In small towns with just a few drivers – or in cities where drivers are in a co-op – they can spend some of their earnings to advertise the taxi company. Livery drivers can offer discounts to riders going a long way. It's a tough job, but it's one in which workers have some agency. Contrast that with driving for Uber: Uber decides which drivers get to even see a job. Uber decides how to market its services. Uber gets to set fares, on a per-passenger basis, meaning that it might choose to scare some passengers off of a few of their rides with high prices, in a bid to psychologically nudge that passenger into accepting higher fares overall. At the same time, Uber is reliant on a minimum pool of drivers cruising the streets, on the clock but off the payroll. If riders had to wait 45 minutes to get an Uber, they'd make other arrangements. If it happened too often, they'd delete the app. So Uber can't survive without those cruising, unpaid drivers, who provide the capacity that make the company commercially viable. What's more, livery cab drivers aren't the only comparators for gig-work platforms. Many gig workers deliver food, meaning that we should compare them to, say, pizza delivery drivers. These drivers aren't just paid when they have a pizza in the car and they're driving to a customer's home. They're paid from the moment they clock onto their shift to the moment they clock off (plus tips). Now, obviously, this is more expensive for employers, but the Uber Eats arrangement – in which drivers are only paid when they've got a pizza in the car and they're en route to a customer – doesn't eliminate that expense. When a gig delivery company takes away the pay that drivers used to get while waiting for a pizza, they're shifting this expense from employers to workers: https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/20/billionaireism/#surveillance-infantalism The fact that Uber can manipulate the concept of a minimum wage in order to claim to pay $21.12/hour to drivers who are making $2.50 per hour creates all kinds of policy distortions. Take Seattle: in 2024, the city implemented a program called \"PayUp\" that sets a \"minimum wage\" for drivers, but it's not a real minimum wage. It's a minimum payment for every ride or delivery. A new National Bureau of Economic Research paper analyzes the program and concludes that it hasn't increased drivers' pay at all: https://www.nber.org/papers/w34545 To which we might say, \"Duh.\" Cranking up the sum paid for a small fraction of the work you do for a company will have very little impact on the overall wage you receive from the company. However, there is an interesting wrinkle in this paper's conclusions. Drivers aren't earning less under this system, either. So they're getting paid more for every delivery, but they're not adding more deliveries to their day. In other words, they're doing less work and then clocking off: https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2026/02/minimum-wages-for-gig-work-cant-work.html A neoclassical economist (someone who has experienced a specific form of neurological injury that makes you incapable of perceiving or reasoning about power) would say that this means that the drivers only desire to earn the sums they were earning before the \"minimum wage\" and so the program hasn't made a difference to their lives. But anyone else can look at this situation and understand that drivers only did this shitty job out of desperation. They had a sum they needed to get every month in order to pay the rent or the grocery bill. They have lots of needs besides those that they would like to fulfill, but not under the shitty gig-work app conditions. The only reason they tolerate a shitty app as their shitty boss at all is that they are desperate, and that desperation gives gig companies power over their workers. In other words, Seattle's PayUp \"minimum wage\" has shifted some of the expense associated with operating a gig platform from workers back onto their bosses. With fewer drivers available on the app, waiting times for customers will necessarily go up. Some of those customers will take the bus, or get a livery cab, or defrost a pizza, or walk to the corner cafe. For the gig platforms to win those customers back, they will have to reduce waiting times, and the most reliable way to do that is to increase the wages paid to their workers. So PayUp isn't a wash – it has changed the distributional outcome of the gig-work economy in Seattle. Drivers have clawed back a surplus – time they can spend doing more productive or pleasant things than cruising and waiting for a booking – from their bosses, who now must face lower profits, either from a loss of business from impatient customers, or from a higher wage they must pay to get those wait-times down again. But if you want to really move the needle on gig workers' wages, the answer is simple: pay workers for all the hours they put in for their bosses, not just the ones where bosses decide they deserve to get paid for.

      "summary": "This is an excellent video about modern UI/UX: \"The Hidden Cost of 'Clean' Design.\" I highly recommend watching it and checking out Ilia's other work. I agree with nearly everything in the video, including this standout quote: If you want to understand a generation, don't listen to what its witnesses say. Look at what it creates. Ilia compares Apple Music and Winamp. One is modern and \"clean\", the other feels \"dated\" to many people. Why does it feel dated? Because it has character. A distinctive style. It is visible . And modern interfaces are so devoid of character and look the same across companies and industries because designers tend to think that good UI should be invisible. This is where I disagree with... well, I’m not sure if it’s Ilia or the general sentiment. Do UX designers today really think their interfaces are invisible? I mean yeah, technically many of them are invisible in a literal sense: transparency and the lack of contrast dialed up to a fault. But I don't think this is what they mean. They mean \"invisible\" in the sense that you don't see the app; instead, you \"experience joy\" with music, \"get entertained\" by streaming, or \"relive memories\" through photos. Winamp and other \"old-school\" programs possess prominent visual features that reflect the personality of their creators. You could argue that such a distinct character adds a visual layer that distracts from the media itself. Yet, I find modern interfaces far more distracting. Not because of colors or shapes, but because in their pursuit of invisibility, designers have created unintuitive, multi-dimensional structures that we are forced to navigate. Structures with almost no connection to reality. Winamp never made me feel stupid. Modern apps make me feel like I'm losing my mind sometimes. Instead of looking at a single screen with many colorful, high-contrast buttons and sliders, I'm flying through ephereal spaces connected with counter-intuitive links that lack consistent visual cues, with animations that do not represent the spatial structure at all. For example, some screens slide from the bottom as if there's a 3D-structure, but another screen would jump out of an icon and completely break that model in my mind. Animations and visual elements no longer represent a coherent model. It all feels like a dream. Structures are fluid and don't really build up into a clear model, ever. (This reminds me of LLM's lack of world model. Perhaps we're training ourselves to be more aligned with AI.) So, on the surface it looks cleaner, but in my mind Apple Music is a lot more dirty, confusing, and disorienting. Like an attractive sociopath.",
