      "summary": "Agentic Engineering Patterns > Sometimes it's useful to have a coding agent give you a structured walkthrough of a codebase. Maybe it's existing code you need to get up to speed on, maybe it's your own code that you've forgotten the details of, or maybe you vibe coded the whole thing and need to understand how it actually works. Frontier models with the right agent harness can construct a detailed walkthrough to help you understand how code works. An example using Showboat and Present I recently vibe coded a SwiftUI slide presentation app on my Mac using Claude Code and Opus 4.6. I was speaking about the advances in frontier models between November 2025 and February 2026, and I like to include at least one gimmick in my talks (a STAR moment - Something They'll Always Remember). In this case I decided the gimmick would be revealing at the end of the presentation that the slide mechanism itself was an example of what vibe coding could do. I released the code to GitHub and then realized I didn't know anything about how it actually worked - I had prompted the whole thing into existence ( partial transcript here without paying any attention to the code it was writing. So I fired up a new instance of Claude Code for web, pointed it at my repo and prompted: Read the source and then plan a linear walkthrough of the code that explains how it all works in detail Then run “uvx showboat –help” to learn showboat - use showboat to create a walkthrough.md file in the repo and build the walkthrough in there, using showboat note for commentary and showboat exec plus sed or grep or cat or whatever you need to include snippets of code you are talking about Showboat is a tool I built to help coding agents write documents that demonstrate their work. You can see the showboat --help output here , which is designed to give the model everything it needs to know in order to use the tool. The showboat note command adds Markdown to the document. The showboat exec command accepts a shell command, executes it and then adds both the command and its output to the document. By telling it to use \"sed or grep or cat or whatever you need to include snippets of code you are talking about\" I ensured that Claude Code would not manually copy snippets of code into the document, since that could introduce a risk of hallucinations or mistakes. This worked extremely well. Here's the document Claude Code created with Showboat , which talks through all six .swift files in detail and provides a clear and actionable explanation about how the code works. I learned a great deal about how SwiftUI apps are structured and absorbed some solid details about the Swift language itself just from reading this document. If you are concerned that LLMs might reduce the speed at which you learn new skills I strongly recommend adopting patterns like this one. Even a ~40 minute vibe coded toy project can become an opportunity to explore new ecosystems and pick up some interesting new tricks.

      "link": "http://antirez.com/news/160",
      "date": "2026-02-24T17:58:02Z",
      "summary": "Anthropic recently released a blog post with the description of an experiment in which the last version of Opus, the 4.6, was instructed to write a C compiler in Rust, in a “clean room” setup. The experiment methodology left me dubious about the kind of point they wanted to make. Why not provide the agent with the ISA documentation? Why Rust? Writing a C compiler is exactly a giant graph manipulation exercise: the kind of program that is harder to write in Rust. Also, in a clean room experiment, the agent should have access to all the information about well established computer science progresses related to optimizing compilers: there are a number of papers that could be easily synthesized in a number of markdown files. SSA, register allocation, instructions selection and scheduling. Those things needed to be researched *first*, as a prerequisite, and the implementation would still be “clean room”. Not allowing the agent to access the Internet, nor any other compiler source code, was certainly the right call. Less understandable is the almost-zero steering principle, but this is coherent with a certain kind of experiment, if the goal was showcasing the completely autonomous writing of a large project. Yet, we all know how this is not how coding agents are used in practice, most of the time. Who uses coding agents extensively knows very well how, even never touching the code, a few hits here and there completely changes the quality of the result. # The Z80 experiment I thought it was time to try a similar experiment myself, one that would take one or two hours at max, and that was compatible with my Claude Code Max plan: I decided to write a Z80 emulator, and then a ZX Spectrum emulator (and even more, a CP/M emulator, see later) in a condition that I believe makes a more sense as “clean room” setup. The result can be found here: https://github.com/antirez/ZOT. # The process I used 1. I wrote a markdown file with the specification of what I wanted to do. Just English, high level ideas about the scope of the Z80 emulator to implement. I said things like: it should execute a whole instruction at a time, not a single clock step, since this emulator must be runnable on things like an RP2350 or similarly limited hardware. The emulator should correctly track the clock cycles elapsed (and I specified we could use this feature later in order to implement the ZX Spectrum contention with ULA during memory accesses), provide memory access callbacks, and should emulate all the known official and unofficial instructions of the Z80. For the Spectrum implementation, performed as a successive step, I provided much more information in the markdown file, like, the kind of rendering I wanted in the RGB buffer, and how it needed to be optional so that embedded devices could render the scanlines directly as they transferred them to the ST77xx display (or similar), how it should be possible to interact with the I/O port to set the EAR bit to simulate cassette loading in a very authentic way, and many other desiderata I had about the emulator. This file also included the rules that the agent needed to follow, like: * Accessing the internet is prohibited, but you can use the specification and test vectors files I added inside ./z80-specs. * Code should be simple and clean, never over-complicate things. * Each solid progress should be committed in the git repository. * Before committing, you should test that what you produced is high quality and that it works. * Write a detailed test suite as you add more features. The test must be re-executed at every major change. * Code should be very well commented: things must be explained in terms that even people not well versed with certain Z80 or Spectrum internals details should understand. * Never stop for prompting, the user is away from the keyboard. * At the end of this file, create a work in progress log, where you note what you already did, what is missing. Always update this log. * Read this file again after each context compaction. 2. Then, I started a Claude Code session, and asked it to fetch all the useful documentation on the internet about the Z80 (later I did this for the Spectrum as well), and to extract only the useful factual information into markdown files. I also provided the binary files for the most ambitious test vectors for the Z80, the ZX Spectrum ROM, and a few other binaries that could be used to test if the emulator actually executed the code correctly. Once all this information was collected (it is part of the repository, so you can inspect what was produced) I completely removed the Claude Code session in order to make sure that no contamination with source code seen during the search was possible. 3. I started a new session, and asked it to check the specification markdown file, and to check all the documentation available, and start implementing the Z80 emulator. The rules were to never access the Internet for any reason (I supervised the agent while it was implementing the code, to make sure this didn’t happen), to never search the disk for similar source code, as this was a “clean room” implementation. 4. For the Z80 implementation, I did zero steering. For the Spectrum implementation I used extensive steering for implementing the TAP loading. More about my feedback to the agent later in this post. 5. As a final step, I copied the repository in /tmp, removed the “.git” repository files completely, started a new Claude Code (and Codex) session and claimed that the implementation was likely stolen or too strongly inspired from somebody else's work. The task was to check with all the major Z80 implementations if there was evidence of theft. The agents (both Codex and Claude Code), after extensive search, were not able to find any evidence of copyright issues. The only similar parts were about well established emulation patterns and things that are Z80 specific and can’t be made differently, the implementation looked distinct from all the other implementations in a significant way. # Results Claude Code worked for 20 or 30 minutes in total, and produced a Z80 emulator that was able to pass ZEXDOC and ZEXALL, in 1200 lines of very readable and well commented C code (1800 lines with comments and blank spaces). The agent was prompted zero times during the implementation, it acted absolutely alone. It never accessed the internet, and the process it used to implement the emulator was of continuous testing, interacting with the CP/M binaries implementing the ZEXDOC and ZEXALL, writing just the CP/M syscalls needed to produce the output on the screen. Multiple times it also used the Spectrum ROM and other binaries that were available, or binaries it created from scratch to see if the emulator was working correctly. In short: the implementation was performed in a very similar way to how a human programmer would do it, and not outputting a complete implementation from scratch “uncompressing” it from the weights. Instead, different classes of instructions were implemented incrementally, and there were bugs that were fixed via integration tests, debugging sessions, dumps, printf calls, and so forth. # Next step: the ZX Spectrum I repeated the process again. I instructed the documentation gathering session very accurately about the kind of details I wanted it to search on the internet, especially the ULA interactions with RAM access, the keyboard mapping, the I/O port, how the cassette tape worked and the kind of PWM encoding used, and how it was encoded into TAP or TZX files. As I said, this time the design notes were extensive since I wanted this emulator to be specifically designed for embedded systems, so only 48k emulation, optional framebuffer rendering, very little additional memory used (no big lookup tables for ULA/Z80 access contention), ROM not copied in the RAM to avoid using additional 16k of memory, but just referenced during the initialization (so we have just a copy in the executable), and so forth. The agent was able to create a very detailed documentation about the ZX Spectrum internals. I provided a few .z80 images of games, so that it could test the emulator in a real setup with real software. Again, I removed the session and started fresh. The agent started working and ended 10 minutes later, following a process that really fascinates me, and that probably you know very well: the fact is, you see the agent working using a number of diverse skills. It is expert in everything programming related, so as it was implementing the emulator, it could immediately write a detailed instrumentation code to “look” at what the Z80 was doing step by step, and how this changed the Spectrum emulation state. In this respect, I believe automatic programming to be already super-human, not in the sense it is currently capable of producing code that humans can’t produce, but in the concurrent usage of different programming languages, system programming techniques, DSP stuff, operating system tricks, math, and everything needed to reach the result in the most immediate way. When it was done, I asked it to write a simple SDL based integration example. The emulator was immediately able to run the Jetpac game without issues, with working sound, and very little CPU usage even on my slow Dell Linux machine (8% usage of a single core, including SDL rendering). Once the basic stuff was working, I wanted to load TAP files directly, simulating cassette loading. This was the first time the agent missed a few things, specifically about the timing the Spectrum loading routines expected, and here we are in the territory where LLMs start to perform less efficiently: they can’t easily run the SDL emulator and see the border changing as data is received and so forth. I asked Claude Code to do a refactoring so that zx_tick() could be called directly and was not part of zx_frame(), and to make zx_frame() a trivial wrapper. This way it was much simpler to sync EAR with what it expected, without callbacks or the wrong abstractions that it had implemented. After such change, a few minutes later the emulator could load a TAP file emulating the cassette without problems. This is how it works now: do { zx_set_ear(zx, tzx_update(&tape, zx->cpu.clocks)); } while (!zx_tick(zx, 0)); I continued prompting Claude Code in order to make the key bindings more useful and a few things more. # CP/M One thing that I found really interesting was the ability of the LLM to inspect the COM files for ZEXALL / ZEXCOM tests for the Z80, easily spot the CP/M syscalls that were used (a total of three), and implement them for the extended z80 test (executed by make fulltest). So, at this point, why not implement a full CP/M environment? Same process again, same good result in a matter of minutes. This time I interacted with it a bit more for the VT100 / ADM3 terminal escapes conversions, reported things not working in WordStar initially, and in a few minutes everything I tested was working well enough (but, there are fixes to do, like simulating a 2Mhz clock, right now it runs at full speed making CP/M games impossible to use). # What is the lesson here? The obvious lesson is: always provide your agents with design hints and extensive documentation about what they are going to do. Such documentation can be obtained by the agent itself. And, also, make sure the agent has a markdown file with the rules of how to perform the coding tasks, and a trace of what it is doing, that is updated and read again quite often. But those tricks, I believe, are quite clear to everybody that has worked extensively with automatic programming in the latest months. To think in terms of “what a human would need” is often the best bet, plus a few LLMs specific things, like the forgetting issue after context compaction, the continuous ability to verify it is on the right track, and so forth. Returning back to the Anthropic compiler attempt: one of the steps that the agent failed was the one that was more strongly related to the idea of memorization of what is in the pretraining set: the assembler. With extensive documentation, I can’t see any way Claude Code (and, even more, GPT5.3-codex, which is in my experience, for complex stuff, more capable) could fail at producing a working assembler, since it is quite a mechanical process. This is, I think, in contradiction with the idea that LLMs are memorizing the whole training set and uncompress what they have seen. LLMs can memorize certain over-represented documents and code, but while they can extract such verbatim parts of the code if prompted to do so, they don’t have a copy of everything they saw during the training set, nor they spontaneously emit copies of already seen code, in their normal operation. We mostly ask LLMs to create work that requires assembling different knowledge they possess, and the result is normally something that uses known techniques and patterns, but that is new code, not constituting a copy of some pre-existing code. It is worth noting, too, that humans often follow a less rigorous process compared to the clean room rules detailed in this blog post, that is: humans often download the code of different implementations related to what they are trying to accomplish, read them carefully, then try to avoid copying stuff verbatim but often times they take strong inspiration. This is a process that I find perfectly acceptable, but it is important to take in mind what happens in the reality of code written by humans. After all, information technology evolved so fast even thanks to this massive cross pollination effect. For all the above reasons, when I implement code using automatic programming, I don’t have problems releasing it MIT licensed, like I did with this Z80 project. In turn, this code base will constitute quality input for the next LLMs training, including open weights ones. # Next steps To make my experiment more compelling, one should try to implement a Z80 and ZX Spectrum emulator without providing any documentation to the agent, and then compare the result of the implementation. I didn’t find the time to do it, but it could be quite informative. Comments",

The old excuses for not writing them - that they're time consuming and expensive to constantly rewrite while a codebase is rapidly evolving - no longer hold when an agent can knock them into shape in just a few minutes. They're also vital for ensuring AI-generated code does what it claims to do. If the code has never been executed it's pure luck if it actually works when deployed to production. Tests are also a great tool to help get an agent up to speed with an existing codebase. Watch what happens when you ask Claude Code or similar about an existing feature - the chances are high that they'll find and read the relevant tests. Agents are already biased towards testing, but the presence of an existing test suite will almost certainly push the agent into testing new changes that it makes. Any time I start a new session with an agent against an existing project I'll start by prompting a variant of the following: First run the tests For my Python projects I have pyproject.toml set up such that I can prompt this instead: Run \"uv run pytest\" These four word prompts serve several purposes: It tells the agent that there is a test suite and forces it to figure out how to run the tests. This makes it almost certain that the agent will run the tests in the future to ensure it didn't break anything. Most test harnesses will give the agent a rough indication of how many tests they are. This can act as a proxy for how large and complex the project is, and also hints that the agent should search the tests themselves if they want to learn more. It puts the agent in a testing mindset. Having run the tests it's natural for it to then expand them with its own tests later on. Similar to \"Use red/green TDD\" , \"First run the tests\" provides a four word prompt that encompasses a substantial amount of software engineering discipline that's already baked into the models.

Colophon: All the rest. Socialist excellence in New York City (permalink) In her magnificent 2023 book Doppelganger, Naomi Klein describes the \"mirror world\" of right wing causes that are weird, conspiratorial versions of the actual things that leftists care about: https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/05/not-that-naomi/#if-the-naomi-be-klein-youre-doing-just-fine For example, Trump rode to power on the back of Qanon, a movement driven by conspiratorial theories of a cabal of rich and powerful people who were kidnapping, trafficking and abusing children. Qanon followers were driven to the most unhinged acts by these theories, shooting up restaurants and demanding to be let into nonexistent basements: https://www.newsweek.com/pizzagate-gunman-killed-north-carolina-qanon-2012850 And while Qanon theories about children being disguised as reasonably priced armoires are facially absurd, the right's obsession with imaginary children is a long-established phenomenon: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-53416247 Think of the conservative movement's all-consuming obsession with the imaginary lives of children that aborted fetuses might have someday become, and its depraved indifference to the hunger and poverty of actual children in America: https://unitedwaynca.org/blog/child-poverty-in-america/ Trump's most ardent followers reorganized their lives around the imagined plight of imaginary children, while making excuses for Trump's first-term \"Kids in Cages\" policy: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-44518942 Obviously, this has only gotten worse in Trump's second term. The same people whose entire political identity is nominally about defending \"unborn children\" are totally indifferent to the actual born children that DOGE left to die by the thousands: https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/usaid-shutdown-has-led-to-hundreds-of-thousands-of-deaths/ They cheered Israel's slaughter and starvation of children during the siege of Gaza and they are cheering it on still today: https://www.savethechildren.net/news/gaza-20000-children-killed-23-months-war-more-one-child-killed-every-hour As for pedophile traffickers, the same Qanon conspiracy theorists who cooked their brains with fantasies about Trump smiting the elite pedophiles are now making excuses for Trump's central role in history's most prolific child rape scandal: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship_of_Donald_Trump_and_Jeffrey_Epstein This is the mirror-world as Klein described it: a real problem (elite impunity for child abuse; the sadistic targeting of children in war crimes; the impact of poverty on children) filtered through a fever-swamp of conspiratorial nonsense. It's world that would do anything to save imaginary children while condemning living, real children to grinding poverty, sexual torture, starvation and murder. Once you know about Klein's mirror-world, you see it everywhere – from conservative panics about the power of Big Tech platforms (that turn out to be panics about what Big Tech does with that power, not about the power of tech itself): https://pluralistic.net/2026/02/13/khanservatives/#kid-rock-eats-shit To conservative panics about health – that turn out to be a demand to dismantle America's weak public health system and America's weak regulation of the supplements industry: https://www.conspirituality.net/episodes/brief-maha-is-a-supplements-grift But lately, I've been thinking that maybe the mirror shines in both directions: that in addition to the warped reflection of the right's mirror world, there is a left mirror world where we can find descrambled, clarified versions of the right's twisted obsessions. I've been thinking about this since I read a Corey Robin blog post about Mamdani's campaign rhetoric, in which Mamdani railed against \"mediocrity\" and promised \"excellence\": https://coreyrobin.com/2025/11/15/excellence-over-mediocrity-from-mamdani-to-marx-to-food/ Robin pointed out that while this framing might strike some leftists as oddly right-coded, it has a lineal descent from Marx, who advocated for industrialization and mass production because the alternative would be \"universal mediocrity.” Robin went on to discuss a largely lost thread of \"socialist perfectionism\" (\"John Ruskin and William Morris to Bloomsbury Bolsheviks like Virginia Woolf and John Maynard Keynes\") who advocated for the public provision of excellence. He identifies Marx's own mirror world analysis, pointing out that Marx identified a fundamental difference between capitalist and socialist theories of the division of labor. While capitalists saw the division of labor as a way to increase quantity, socialists were excited by the prospect of increasing quality. (There's a centaur/reverse centaur comparison lurking in there, too. If you're a centaur radiologist, who gets an AI tool that flags some diagnoses you may have missed, then you're improving the rate of tumor identification. If you're a reverse centaur radiologist who sees 90% of your colleagues fired and replaced with a chatbot whose work you are expected to sign off on at a rate that precludes even cursory inspection, you're increasing X-ray throughput at the expense of accuracy): https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/05/pop-that-bubble/#u-washington (In other words: the reverse centaur is the mirror world version of a centaur.) After the mayoral election, Mamdani doubled down on his pursuit of high-quality public services. In his inaugural speech, Mamdani promised a government \"where excellence is no longer the exception\": https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/01/nyregion/mamdani-inauguration-speech-transcript.html Robin was also developing his appreciation for Mamadani's vision of public excellence. In the New York Review of Books, Robin made the case that it was a mistake for Democrats to have ceded the language of efficiency and quality to Republicans: https://www.nybooks.com/online/2025/12/31/democratic-excellence-zohran-mamdani/ Where Democrats do talk about efficiency, they talk about it in Republican terms: \"We'll run the government like a business.\" Mamdani, by contrast, talks about running the government like a government – a good government, a government committed to excellence. Writing in Jacobin, Conor Lynch takes a trip into the good side of the mirror world, unpacking the idea of socialist excellence in Mamdani's governance promises: https://jacobin.com/2026/02/zohran-mamdani-efficiency-nyc-budget/ During the Mamdani campaign, \"efficiency\" was just one plank of the platform. But once Mamdani took office, he learned that his predecessor, the lavishly corrupt Eric Adams, had lied about the city's finances, leaving a $12b hole in the budget: https://www.nyc.gov/mayors-office/news/2026/01/mayor-mamdani-details–adams-budget-crisis- Mamdani came to power in New York on an ambitious platform of public service delivery, and not just because this is the right thing to do, but because investment in a city's people and built environment pays off handsomely. Maintenance is always cheaper than repair, and one of the main differences between a business and a government is that a business's shareholders can starve maintenance budgets, cash out, and leave the collapsing firm behind them, while governments must think about the long term consequences of short-term thinking (the fact that so many Democratic governments have failed to do this is a consequence of Democrats adopting Republicans' framing that a good government is \"run like a business\"). The best time to invest in New York City was 20 years ago. The second best time in now. For Mamdani to make those investments and correct the failures of his predecessors, he needs to find some money. Mamdani's proposal for finding this money sounds pretty conservative: he's going to cut waste in government. He's ordered each city agency to appoint a \"Chief Savings Officer\" who will \"review performance, eliminate waste and streamline service delivery.\" These CSOs are supposed to find a 1.5% across-the-board savings this year and 2.5% next year: https://www.nyc.gov/mayors-office/news/2026/01/mayor-mamdani-signs-executive-order-to-require-chief-savings-off Does this sound like DOGE to you? It kind of does to me, but – crucially – this is mirror-world DOGE. DOGE's project was to make cuts to government in order to make government \"run like a business.\" Specifically, DOGE wanted to transform the government into the kind of business that makes cuts to juice the quarterly numbers at the expense of long-term health: https://www.forbes.com/sites/suzannerowankelleher/2024/10/24/southwest-airlines-bends-to-activist-investor-restructures-board/ But Mamdani's mirror-world DOGE is looking to find efficiencies by cutting things like sweetheart deals with private contractors and consultants, who cost the city billions. It's these private sector delegates of the state that are the source of government waste and bloat. The literature is clear on this: when governments eliminate their own capacity to serve the people and hire corporations to do it on their behalf, the corporations charge more and deliver less: https://calmatters.org/commentary/2019/02/public-private-partnerships-are-an-industry-gimmick-that-dont-serve-public-well/ As Lynch writes, DOGE's purpose was to dismantle as much of the government as possible and shift its duties to Beltway Bandits who could milk Uncle Sucker for every dime. Mamdani's ambition, meanwhile, is to \"restore faith in government [and] demonstrate that the public sector can match or even surpass the private sector in excellence.\" As Mamdani said in his inauguration speech, \"For too long, we have turned to the private sector for greatness, while accepting mediocrity from those who serve the public.\" Turning governments into businesses has been an unmitigated failure. After decades of outsourcing, the government hasn't managed to shrink its payroll, but government workers are today primarily employed in wheedling private contractors to fulfill their promises, even as public spending has quintupled: https://www.brookings.edu/articles/is-government-too-big-reflections-on-the-size-and-composition-of-todays-federal-government/ Instead of having a government employee do a government job, that govvie oversees a private contractor who costs twice as much…and sucks at their job: https://www.pogo.org/reports/bad-business-billions-of-taxpayer-dollars-wasted-on-hiring-contractors There's a wonderful illustration of this principle at work in Edward Snowden's 2019 memoir Permanent Record: https://memex.craphound.com/2019/09/24/permanent-record-edward-snowden-and-the-making-of-a-whistleblower/ After Snowden broke both his legs during special forces training and washed out, he went to work for the NSA. After a couple years, his boss told him that Congress capped the spy agencies' headcount but not their budgets, so he was going to have to quit his job at the NSA and go to work for one of the NSA's many contractors, because the NSA could hire as many contractors as it wanted. So Snowden is sent to a recruiter who asks him how much he's making as a government spy. Snowden quotes a modest 5-figure sum. The recruiter is aghast and tells Snowden that he gets paid a percentage of whatever Snowden ends up making as a government contractor, and promptly triples Snowden's government salary. Why not? The spy agencies have unlimited budgets, and will pay whatever the private company that Snowden nominally works for bills them at. Everybody wins! Ladies and gentlemen, the efficiency of government outsourcing. Run the government like a business! As bad as this is when the government hires outside contractors to do things, it's even worse when they hire outside contractors to consult on things. Under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the Canadian government spent a fortune on consultants, especially at the start of the pandemic: https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/31/mckinsey-and-canada/#comment-dit-beltway-bandits-en-canadien The main beneficiary of these contracts was McKinsey, who were given a blank cheque and no oversight – they were even exempted from rules requiring them to disclose conflicts of interest. Trudeau raised Canadian government spending by 40%, to $11.8 billion, creating a \"shadow civil service\" that cost vastly more than the actual civil service – the government spent $1.85b on internal IT expertise, and $2.3b on outside contractors. These contractors produced some of the worst IT boondoggles in government history, including the bungled \"ArriveCAN\" contact tracing program. The two-person shop that won the contract outsourced it to KPMG and raked off a 15-30% commission. Before Trudeau, Stephen Harper paid IBM to build Phoenix – a payroll system that completely failed and was, amazingly, far worse than ArriveCAN. IBM got $309m to build Phoenix, and then Canada spent another $506m to fix it and compensate the people whose lives it ruined. Wherever you find these contractors, you find stupendous waste and fraud. I remember in the early 2000s, when Dan \"City of Sound\" Hill was working at the BBC and wanted to try an experiment to distribute MP3s of a radio programme. The BBC – an organization with a long history of technical excellence – had given the exclusive contract for web delivery to Siemens, who wanted £10,000 to set up a web-server for the experiment. Dan rented a server from an online provider and put it all on his personal card, serving tens of thousands of MP3s for less than £10. It turns out that letting your technical personnel do your technology development costs 1/1000th of what it costs to have contractors do it. Running your public institution \"like a business\" is incredibly inefficient. Back when Musk and Ramaswamy announced their plan to cut $2t from the US federal budget, David Dayen published a plan to realize nearly that much savings just by attacking waste arising from running the government \"like a business\": https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/27/beltway-bandits/#henhouse-foxes The US government's own estimate of the losses due to contractor fraud comes out to $274b/year – roughly the size of the entire civil service payroll (the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which Musk sadistically destroyed, accounts for 0.012% of federal spending). Medicare \"upcoding\" – a form of fraud committed by companies like United Healthcare, the largest Medicare Advantage provider in the country – costs the public $83b/year: https://www.medpac.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Mar24_ExecutiveSummary_MedPAC_Report_To_Congress_SEC.pdf Congress has banned Medicare and Medicaid from bargaining for pharma prices, which is why the US government pays 178% more than other governments, for the same drugs, which are often developed at public expense: https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/comparing-prescription-drugs The Pentagon is a cesspit of waste. It's not just firing spies and rehiring them as contractors at a 300% markup – that's just for starters. The Pentagon receives $840b/year and has failed its last three audits: https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4992913-pentagon-fails-7th-audit-in-a-row-but-says-progress-made/ The conservative version of \"efficiency\" cashes out to \"efficient at extracting value from public institutions, workers and customers.\" Mamdani's (good) mirror world \"efficiency\" means providing great public service through investing in public excellence. New York City is overdue for this kind of overhaul. Everywhere you look in the city, you find high price consultants making out like bandits and starving the city of the funds it needs to deliver. The Second Avenue subway spent more on consultants than it spent on digging tunnels: https://gothamist.com/news/mta-plans-to-hire-186m-consultant-to-oversee-second-avenue-subway-construction Mamdani has pledged to audit the Department of Education's 25 largest contracts (the DOE spends $10b/year on outside contractors). He's rolling out \"fiscal training and certification\" for any government employee involved in procurement. Mamdani isn't pretending he can bridge the gap that Adams left in the city's finances through efficiency alone: to make up the difference, he is going to tax NYC's millionaires, and ask the state to \"rebalance\" its relationship with NYC's taxpayers (NYC contributes 54.4% of the state budget, but only gets 40.5% in return). As Lynch writes, NYC was the birthplace of austerity-driven outsourcing, following from the city's bankruptcy in 1975. 50 years later, Mamdani is bringing that age to a close. Mamdani knows what the stakes are, too. He called efficiency \"the most paramount left-wing concern, because it is either the fulfillment or the betrayal of that which motivates so much of our politics\": https://www.derekthompson.org/p/what-speaks-to-me-about-abundance Mamdani is reviving the tradition of \"sewer socialism,\" a governing philosophy based on \"bringing people into your politics by improving their lives in obvious ways\": https://jacobin.com/2025/12/digital-sewer-socialism-public-ownership Sewer socialism, public excellence, real efficiency: these are the (good) mirror world versions of the right's obsession with \"government efficiency.\" On the conservative side of the mirror, \"efficiency\" is an excuse for hamstringing government employees and turning their budgets over to lazy, crooked contractors. On the left's side of the mirror, \"efficiency\" is building capacity in democratically accountable institutions that care about helping every person, and who deliver tomorrow's excellence by making long-term investments today.

      "summary": "Sometimes, I have 50 tabs open. Looking for a single piece of information ends up being a rapid click on each tab until I find what I'm looking for. Somehow, every time I get to that LinkedIn tab, I pause for a second. I just have to click on the little red dot in the top right corner, see that there is nothing new, then resume my clicking. Why is that? Why can't I ignore the red notification badge? When you sign up for LinkedIn for the first time, it's right there. A little red dot in the top right corner with a number in it. It stands out against the muted grays and blues of the interface. Click on it, and you'll discover you have a notification. It's not from someone you know; this is a fresh new account, after all. But the dot was there anyway. Add a few connections, give it some time, and come back. Refresh the page, and you'll have new notifications waiting. If your LinkedIn account is like mine, a ghost town, you still get the little red dot. My connections and I usually keep a few recruiters in our networks, an insurance policy in case we need to find work quickly. But we rarely, if ever, post anything. Yet whenever I log in, there's a new notification. Sometimes it's even a message, but not from anyone in my connections list. It's from LinkedIn itself. The little red dot isn't exclusive to LinkedIn. My Facebook account has been dormant for years, yet those few times annually when I log in, the notifications are right there waiting for me. I've even visited news websites where the little red dot appeared for reasons I couldn't understand. I didn't have an account, so what exactly were they notifying me about? That little red dot is a sophisticated psychological trigger designed to exploit the brain. It activates the brain's Salience Network . Think of it as a circuit breaker that alerts us to immediate threats. When triggered, it signals that the brain should redirect its resources to something new. The color red is not chosen by accident either. On my Twitter app, the notification is a blue dot, which I hardly ever notice (don't tell them that). But red triggers our brain to perceive urgency. We feel compelled to address it immediately. The little red dot fools us into believing that something trivial is actually urgent. Check your phone and you'll notice all the app icons with a little red dot in their top right corner. Most, if not all, social media alerts function as false alarms, and they gradually compromise our ability to focus on what matters. Whenever you spot the little red dot, you feel compelled to click it. It promises a new connection, a message, a validation of some sort. It doesn't matter that you are almost always disappointed afterward, because you will be presented with content that keeps you scrolling, never remembering how you got there. Facebook used to show the little red dot in their email notifications. When there is activity on your account, say you were tagged in a photo, Facebook sends you an email and in the top right corner, they draw a little red dot on the bell icon. Obviously, you have to click it so you don't miss out. Note: my old facebook emails have broken images, but linkedin just sent me a new email with the red dot in it. There was a Netflix documentary released a few years ago called The Social Dilemma , an inside look at how social media manipulates its users. Whether intentional or not, their website featured a bell icon with a little red dot on it. You visit the site for the first time, and it shows that you have one notification. There's no way around it, you are psychologically enticed to click. A notification is supposed to be a tool, and a tool patiently waits for someone to use it. But the little red dot seduces you because it wants something from you. It's all part of habit-forming technology: the engagement loop. The engagement loop follows three steps: a cue (the notification), a routine (an action such as scrolling), and a reward (likes, a dopamine hit). From the social media platform's perspective, this is a tool for boosting retention. From the user's perspective, it's Pavlovian conditioning. For every possible event, LinkedIn will send you a notification. Someone wants to join your network. Someone has endorsed your skills. A group is discussing a topic. Each notification generates a red dot on your mobile device, pulling you back into actions that benefit LinkedIn's system. In the documentary, they show that this pattern is just the tip of the iceberg. Beneath the surface lies a data-driven, manipulative machine that feeds on our behavior and engineers the next trick to bring us back to the platform. For my part, I've disabled notifications from all non-essential apps. No Instagram updates, no Robinhood alerts, no WhatsApp group messages. I receive messages from people I know. That's pretty much it. For everything else, I have to deliberately seek out information. That said, I did see another approach in the wild. Some people simply don't care about notifications. Every app on their phone has a little red dot with the number \"99\" on it. They haven't read their messages and aren't planning to. You're lucky if they ever answer your call. I'm not sure whether this is a good or bad thing... but it's a thing. That little red dot represents something larger than a notification system. It's the visible tip of an infrastructure built to capture and commodify human attention. The addictiveness of social media isn't an unfortunate byproduct of connecting the world. Right now it's the most profitable business model. The more addictive the platform, the more you engage; the more you engage, the more advertisements you see. This addiction shapes behavior, consumes time, and affects mental wellbeing, all while companies profit from it.",

Colophon: All the rest. Deplatform yourself (permalink) The first time I met William Gibson – to interview him for the Globe and Mail on the release of 1999's All Tomorrow's Parties – there was one question I knew I wanted to ask him: \"What happens to the counterculture in the era of instantaneous commodification?\" https://craphound.com/nonfic/transcript.html Gibson's answer stuck with me for decades: What we're doing pop culturally is like burning the rain forest. The biodiversity of pop culture is really, really in danger. I didn't see it coming until a few years ago, but looking back it's very apparent. I watched a sort of primitive form of the recommodification machine around my friends and myself in the sixties, and it took about two years for this clumsy mechanism to get and try to sell us The Monkees. In 1977, it took about eight months for a slightly faster more refined mechanism to put punk in the window of Holt Renfrew. It's gotten faster ever since. The scene in Seattle that Nirvana came from: as soon as it had a label, it was on the runways of Paris. There's no grace period, so that's a way in which I see us losing the interstitial. This may seem like an odd thing to think about, but nearly all the art and culture that means something to me started as something that was transgressive and weird, and even if it was eventually metabolized by the mainstream, that was only after it had a chance to ferment and mutate in a tide-pool of Bohemian weirdness. All this century, I've asked friends and weirdos about what can resist this commodification and co-option. Scott Westerfeld – author of Uglies – had a very on-brand answer: he told me that he thought that teenagers might deliberately start cultivating acne as a badge of rebellion. That hasn't happened yet, but if it does, it will be born co-opted, because there's already a luxury brand called \"Acne\": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acne_Studios One anti-commodification measure that's worked reasonably well over the years is to be ugly. Punk zines and early Myspace pages embraced an aesthetic that the existing cohort of trained designers available to work for would-be co-opters would rather break their fingers than imitate. Eventually, some punk zinesters and Myspacers became freelance designers and offered the aesthetic for sale, but after the \"grace period\" that Gibson was worried about in 1999. By contrast, after a brief period in which early AI image-gen snuck psychedelic fish-dogs into every output, AI became so mid and inoffensive that even when it was used to make transgressive images (Trump spraying protesters with liquid shit from an airplane), it looked incredibly, terminally normal: https://pluralistic.net/2024/07/20/ransom-note-force-field/#antilibraries There's more than one way to be ugly, of course. The \"edgelords\" that defined forums like SomethingAwful and /b/ made heavy use of slurs, rape \"jokes\" and other beyond-the-pale rhetoric. Whether this reflected sincerely felt beliefs or a mere desire to shock (or both), it had the effect of making these subcultures very difficult to commodify. If you and your friends barely utter a single sentence that can be quoted in a mainstream news forum or office email, it's going to be very hard to co-opt you. For a long time, edgelords festered in the \"dark corners\" of the internet. But that's changed. The Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes – who thinks that \"every woman and girl\" should be \"sent to a gulag\" – has had dinner at the White House: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nick-fuentes-women-gulag/ Last week, Ryan Broderick wrote a short, striking article for his must-read Garbage Day newsletter about the way that the far right have become \"cool\" within Gen Z by being so outre that they were evicted from the major platforms (before Trump II, that is): https://www.garbageday.email/p/the-only-taboo-left-is-copyright-infringement As Broderick writes, \"cool\" isn't just \"trends\" (\"hyperpop, brainrot, crowdwork comedy, Instagram collages, their weird post-COVID pop punk exploration\"). For Broderick, cool things used to become trends after they were \"begrudgingly canonized\" by the likes of Time Magazine. But with Hollywood replaced by Youtube, magazines replaced by Tiktok, and radio replaced by Spotify, that looks very different today. Today's version of artist management teams is \"hype houses.\" All forms of cultural activity have collapsed into a single, overriding imperative: \"getting attention.\" Which brings Broderick to his main question: If everything is just attention now, and attention is completely commodified by algorithmic tech platforms, how can you push back against that? His answer: \"You have to essentially pre-deplatform yourself.\" For young people, \"the only things that have the level of scarcity and danger required to be seen as cool\" are \"whatever is unacceptable on those platforms.\" In other words, anything (and maybe only things) that're blocked or banned are a candidate to be cool. Cool people walk away from the places where you'd expect to find them and hang out in places that are culturally viewed as less important. Broderick argues that this is the source of far-right influencers' influence: the fact that manosphere weirdos and trolls are hanging out in \"shadowy corners\" like Kick makes them feel authentic and outside of the norm and thus intrinsically interesting. And (Broderick continues) the fact that these manosphere types are now totally reliant on Discord clip-farmers has made them feel more mainstream and thus potentially less interesting. This is where it gets cool. Broderick argues that there's nothing intrinsically reactionary about this kind of self-deplatforming as a parallel evolution taking place in progressive media. When Stephen Colbert's Trump-colonized network bans him from airing an interview with a Democratic politician, he puts it on Youtube instead, where it gets far more attention than it would have if the network had just left him alone. But by and large it's not Democratic politicians who are too dangerous for the platforms – it's copyright infringement. The law makes it very easy to get things removed via unproven accusations of copyright infringement, and the platforms make it even easier: https://pluralistic.net/2024/06/27/nuke-first/#ask-questions-never Copyright is a doctrine that, by design, has very fuzzy edges where things may or may not be prohibited. But in the digital world, those edges are often erased, even as the zone of lawful activity they enclose contracts. This means that media that can be accused of infringing copyright is the most unwelcome content on platforms. Broderick's theory predicts that the \"coolest\" media – the stuff that makes taste – is the stuff that fits in this zone of copyright infringement. He cites some compelling case studies, like Vera Drew's \"The People's Joker,\" an amazing, unauthorized Batman mashup/trans allegory. Warner shut down multiple screenings of The People's Joker (including at TIFF), and this increased the coolness and prominence of the movie, driving people to underground screenings: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_People%27s_Joker A more contemporary version is Nirvanna The Band The Show The Movie, which Broderick describes as \"a copyright rats nest\" based on a web series that is \"completely illegal to watch on streaming platforms\": https://pagesix.com/2026/02/14/hollywood/how-nirvanna-the-band-the-show-the-movie-skirted-copyright-law/ Despite this/because of this, NTBTSTM just had \"the biggest opening ever for a live-action Canadian film\": https://x.com/hertzbarry/status/2023521583923663342 Broderick's conclusion is that \"as platforms police speech less and less, edgelords lose their sheen,\" but that this material, at or beyond the edge of copyright, unwelcome on platforms, is the future face of cool. And here's where Broderick really got me: \"the most dangerous thing for platforms is not racist garbage. It’s unmonetizeable content.\" I make a lot of \"unmonetizable content,\" starting with this blog, which has no metrics, no analytics, and (of course) no ads. I refuse to add social media cards, and hide obscure jokes in incredibly long URLs that get truncated on social media. I labor for hours over the weird illustrations that go at the top of the posts, which I release (along with the text they accompany) under Creative Commons licenses that let pretty much anyone do pretty much anything with them, without asking me, telling me, or paying me (it's always very funny when someone accuses me of publishing this work as clickbait – clickbait for what? To increase bandwidth consumption at my server?). I do this to \"woo the muse of the odd,\" a phrase I lifted from Bruce Sterling's 1991 keynote for the Game Developers' Conference, a talk that struck me so hard that I dropped out of university to make weird multimedia shortly after reading it: https://lib.ru/STERLINGB/story.txt It's a great talk, but the best parts are where Sterling grapples with this question of coolness, counterculture, and commodification: In the immortal words of Lafcadio Hearn, a geek of incredible obscurity whose work is still in print after a hundred years, \"woo the muse of the odd.\" A good science fiction story is not a \"good story\" with a polite whiff of rocket fuel in it. A good science fiction story is something that knows it is science fiction and plunges through that and comes roaring out of the other side. Computer entertainment should not be more like movies, it shouldn't be more like books, it should be more like computer entertainment, SO MUCH MORE LIKE COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT THAT IT RIPS THROUGH THE LIMITS AND IS SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE! I don't think you can last by meeting the contemporary public taste, the taste from the last quarterly report. I don't think you can last by following demographics and carefully meeting expectations. I don't know many works of art that last that are condescending. I don't know many works of art that last that are deliberately stupid… Get weird. Get way weird. Get dangerously weird. Get sophisticatedly, thoroughly weird and don't do it halfway, put every ounce of horsepower you have behind it. It's been more than 30 years since I read that essay, more than a quarter century since I asked William Gibson whether Madison Avenue \"finds its own use for things.\" Over the ensuing decades, media has become ever-better at \"following demographics and carefully meeting expectations,\" thanks to vast troves of behavioral data correlated with media analytics. That process has only accelerated the \"recommodification machine\" that Gibson worried about in 1999, but as Broderick points out, there's one thing that is even harder to co-op than acne – \"unmonetizable content,\" the Kryptonite of the platforms.

      "summary": "Nvidia was only invited to invest. That is one reversal of commitment. Remember that graph that has been circling around for some time now? The one that shows the circular investment from AI companies: Basically Nvidia will invest $100 billion in OpenAI. OpenAI will then invest $300 billion in Oracle, then Oracle invests back into Nvidia. Now, Jensen Huang, the Nvidia CEO, is back tracking and saying he never made that commitment . “It was never a commitment. They invited us to invest up to $100 billion and of course, we were, we were very happy and honored that they invited us, but we will invest one step at a time.” So he never committed? Did we make up all these graphs in our head? Was it a misquote from a journalist somewhere that sparkled all this frenzy? Well, you can take a look in OpenAI press release in September of 2025 . They wrote: NVIDIA intends to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as the new NVIDIA systems are deployed. In fact, Jensen Huang went on to say: “NVIDIA and OpenAI have pushed each other for a decade, from the first DGX supercomputer to the breakthrough of ChatGPT. This investment and infrastructure partnership mark the next leap forward—deploying 10 gigawatts to power the next era of intelligence.” It sounds like Jensen is distancing himself from that $100 billion commitment. Did he take a peak inside OpenAI and change his mind? At the same time, OpenAI is experimenting with ads. Sam Altman stated before that they would only ever use ads as a last resort. It sounds like we are in the phase.",

      "summary": "Today's links A perforated corporate veil: The Brazilian method for curbing corporate power. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Social media turned US parties into host organisms for third parties; \"Citizens\" are hired actors; Insured exoskeletons; Talking with Snowden and Gibson. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. A perforated corporate veil (permalink) \"Capitalist realism\" is the idea that the world's current economic and political arrangements are inevitable, and that any attempt to alter them is a) irrational; b) doomed; and c) dangerous. It's the ideology of Margaret Thatcher's maxim, \"There is no alternative.\" Obviously this is very convenient if you are a current beneficiary of the status quo. \"There is no alternative\" is a thought-stopping demand dressed up as an observation. It means, \"Don't try and think of alternatives.\" The thing is, alternatives already exist and work very well. The Mondragon co-ops in Spain constitute a fully worked out, long-term stable economic alternative to traditional capitalist enterprises, employing more than 100,000 people and generating tangible, empirically measured benefits to workers, customers and the region: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation Proponents of capitalist realism will tell you that Mondragon doesn't count. Maybe it's just a one-off. Or maybe it's just not big enough. 100,000 workers sounds like a lot, but Amazon has over 1.5m employees and untold numbers of misclassified contractors who are employees in everything but name (and legal rights). This is some pretty transparent goalpost moving, but sure, let's stipulate that Mondragon doesn't prove that there are broadly applicable alternatives to the dominant capitalism of the mid-2020s. Are there other examples of \"an alternative?\" There sure are. Let's look at limited liability. Limited liability – the idea that a company's shareholders cannot be held liable for the company's misdeeds – is a bedrock of capitalist dogma. The story goes that until the advent of the \"joint stock enterprise\" (and its handmaiden, limited liability) there was no efficient way to do \"capital formation\" (raising money for a project or business). Because of this, the only ambitious, capital-intensive projects were those that caught the fancy of a king, a Pope, or an aristocrat. But once limited liability appears on the scene, many people of modest means can jointly invest in a project without worrying about being bankrupted if it turns out that the people running it are crooks or bumblers. That lets you, say, buy a single share of a company without having to keep daily tabs on the management's every action without worrying that if they go wrong, someone they've hurt will sue you for everything you've got. Capital formation is a real thing, and limited liability unquestionably facilitates capital formation. There are plenty of good things in the world that exist because limited liability protections allowed everyday people to help bring them into existence. This isn't just stuff that makes a lot of money for capitalism's true believers, it includes everything from the company that makes the printing presses that your favorite anarchist zine runs on to the mill that makes the alloys for the e-bike you use to get to a demonstration. This is where capitalist realism comes in. Capitalist realists will claim that there is no way to do capital formation for these beneficial goods without limited liability – and not just any limited liability, but maximum limited liability in which the \"corporate veil\" can never be pierced to assign culpability to any shareholder. The capitalist realist claim is that the corporate veil is like the skin of a balloon, and that any attempt to poke even the smallest hole in it will cause it to rupture and vanish. But this just isn't true, and we can tell, because one of the largest economies in the world has operated with a perforated corporate veil for nearly a century, and that economy hasn't suffered from capital formation problems. Quite the contrary, some of the world's largest (and most destructive) monopolies are headquartered in this country where the veil of limited liability is thoroughly perforated. The country I'm talking about is Brazil, which has had limited limited liability since 1937: https://lpeproject.org/blog/when-workers-pierce-the-corporate-veil-brazils-forgotten-innovation/ As Mariana Pargendler writes for the LPE Project, Brazil put limits on limited liability to address a common pattern of corporate abuse. Companies would set up in Brazil, incur a lot of liabilities (say, by poisoning the land, water and air, or by stealing from or maiming workers), and then, when the wheels of justice caught up with them, the companies would fold and re-establish themselves the next day under a new name. Like I say, this happens all over the world. It's incredibly common, and even the pettiest of crooks know how to use this trick. I know someone whose NYC apartment was flooded by the upstairs neighbor, who decided that they didn't need to worry about the fact that their toilet wouldn't stop running – for months, until the walls of the apartment downstairs dissolved in a slurry of black mold. The upstairs neighbor owned the apartment through an LLC, which they simply folded up and walked away from, while my friend was stuck with a giant bill and no one to sue. The limited liability company is the scammer's best friend. In the UK, an anti-tax extremist invented a tax-evasion scam whereby landlords pretend that their empty commercial buildings are tax-exempt \"snail farms\" by scattering around some boxes with a few snails in them: https://www.patreon.com/posts/149255928?collection=1941093 When this results in inevitable stonking fines and adverse judgments, the \"snail farmers\" duck liability by folding up their limited liability company after transferring its assets to a new LLC. Capitalist realists will tell you that this is just the price of efficient capital formation. Without total, airtight limited liability – the sort that allows for this kind of obvious, petty ripoff – no one would be able to raise capital for anything. Brazil begs to differ. In 1937, Brazil made parent companies liable for their subsidiaries' obligations, with a system of \"joint and several liability\" for LLCs. This was expanded with 1943's Consolidation of Labor Laws, and it worked so well that the Brazilian legislature expanded it again in 2017. Remember back in 2024, when Elon Musk defied a Brazilian court order about Twitter, only to have Brazil freeze Starlink's assets until Musk caved? That was the \"joint and several\" liability system: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/world/americas/brazil-musk-x-starlink.html As Pargendler writes, Brazil's liability system \"represented a distributive choice: prioritizing Brazilian workers’ ability to enforce their rights over foreign capital’s interest in minimizing costs through corporate structuring.\" Pargendler (who teaches at Harvard Law) co-authored a paper with São Paulo Law's Olívia Pasqualeto analyzing the impact that Brazil's limited liability system had on capital formation and corporate conduct: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=6105586 Unsurprisingly, they find that there has been a steady pressure to erode the joint and several system, but also that some countries (the US and France) have a \"joint employer\" doctrine that is a weak form of this. Portugal, meanwhile, adopted the Brazilian system, 70 years after Brazil – this transposition of law from a former colony to a former colonial power is apparently called \"reverse convergence\": https://lpeproject.org/blog/heterodox-corporate-laws-in-the-global-south/ More countries in the global south have adopted regimes similar to Brazil's, like Venezuela and Chile. Other countries go further, like Mozambique and Angola. Somewhere in between are other Latin American countries like Peru and Uruguay, where these rules have entered practice through judicial rulings, not legislation. The authors don't claim that perforating the corporate veil solves all the problems of exploitative, fraudulent or corrupt corporate conduct. Rather, they're challenging the capitalist realist doctrine that insists that this system couldn't possibly exist, and if it did, it would be a disaster. A hundred years of Brazilian law, and Brazil's globe-spanning corporate giants, beg to differ. (Image: Gage Skidmore, CC BY-SA 2.0, modified) Hey look at this (permalink) Rep.

      "summary": "A few years back, the term \"AI\" took an unexpected turn when it was redefined as \"Actual Indian\". As in, a person in India operating the machine remotely. I first heard the term when Amazon was boasting about their cashierless grocery stores. There was a big sign in the store that said \"Just Walk Out,\" meaning you grab your items, walk out, and get charged the correct amount automatically. How did they do it? According to Amazon, they used AI. What kind of AI exactly, nobody was quite sure. But customers started reporting something odd. They weren't charged immediately after leaving the store. Some said it took several days for a charge to appear on their account. It eventually came out that the technology was sophisticated tracking performed by Amazon's team in India. Workers would manually review footage of each customer's visit and charge them accordingly. This operation was impressive. Coordinating thousands of store visits, matching items to customers across multiple camera angles, and doing it accurately enough that most people never noticed the delay. But because it was buried under the \"AI\" label, the moment the truth came out, the whole thing became a punchline. In 2024, Tesla held their \"We, Robot\" event, where Optimus robots operated a bar. They were serving drinks, dancing, and mingling with guests. It was a pretty impressive display. The robots moved fluidly, held conversations, and handed off drinks without fumbling. Elon Musk claimed they were AI-driven , fully autonomous. People were genuinely impressed by the interactions, and for good reason. Fluid, bipedal locomotion in a crowded social environment is an extraordinarily hard robotics problem. The moment it came out that the robots were teleoperated, the sentiment flipped entirely. It didn't matter how dexterous or natural the movement was. It felt like a magic trick exposed. But think about what was actually being demonstrated. Humanoid robots walking through a crowd, responding in real time to a human operator's inputs, without tripping over guests or spilling drinks. That's not nothing. Slapping \"AI\" on it turned an engineering achievement into a scandal. More recently, the company 1X unveiled a friendly humanoid robot available for purchase at $20,000. The demo looks genuinely impressive. The robot can perform domestic tasks like doing laundry, folding clothes, and navigating a home environment. And if it doesn't know how to do something, it can be taught. You can authorize a remote worker to take control, demonstrate the task, and the robot learns from that demonstration, adding it to its growing repertoire. That's a legitimately interesting approach to machine learning through human guidance. What got glossed over is how much of the current capability relies on that remote worker. Right after the unveiling, the Wall Street Journal was invited to test the robots. In their video, the robot is being operated entirely by a person sitting in the next room. To be fair, the smoothness of that teleoperation is itself a technical achievement. Real-time control of a bipedal robot performing fine motor tasks, like folding a shirt, requires low-latency communication, precise motor control, and a well-designed interface for the operator. That's years of engineering work. But because teleoperation isn't the product being sold, AI is,that achievement gets treated as evidence of fraud. We've built an environment where \"teleoperated\" has become a slur, and anything short of full autonomy is seen as cheating. Even Waymo, whose self-driving cars have logged millions of autonomous miles, feels compelled to publicly defend themselves against accusations of secretly using remote operators. As if any human involvement would invalidate everything they've built. I think teleoperation is pretty impressive. It's a valuable technology in its own right. Surgeons use it to operate across continents. Industrial operators use it to work in places no human could safely go. In all of these cases, having a human-in-the-loop is the point. Every \"AI\" product that turns out to have a person behind the curtain makes the public more skeptical. In a parallel universe, there is a version of the tech industry that celebrates teleoperation as a stepping stone. Where we are building tools to make collaboration easier through teleoperation, and it's not viewed as an embarrassing secret.",
