      "summary": "Ladybird adopts Rust, with help from AI Really interesting case-study from Andreas Kling on advanced, sophisticated use of coding agents for ambitious coding projects with critical code. After a few years hoping Swift's platform support outside of the Apple ecosystem would mature they switched tracks to Rust their memory-safe language of choice, starting with an AI-assisted port of a critical library: Our first target was LibJS , Ladybird's JavaScript engine. The lexer, parser, AST, and bytecode generator are relatively self-contained and have extensive test coverage through test262 , which made them a natural starting point. I used Claude Code and Codex for the translation. This was human-directed, not autonomous code generation. I decided what to port, in what order, and what the Rust code should look like. It was hundreds of small prompts, steering the agents where things needed to go. [...] The requirement from the start was byte-for-byte identical output from both pipelines. The result was about 25,000 lines of Rust, and the entire port took about two weeks. The same work would have taken me multiple months to do by hand. We’ve verified that every AST produced by the Rust parser is identical to the C++ one, and all bytecode generated by the Rust compiler is identical to the C++ compiler’s output. Zero regressions across the board. Having an existing conformance testing suite of the quality of test262 is a huge unlock for projects of this magnitude, and the ability to compare output with an existing trusted implementation makes agentic engineering much more of a safe bet.

      "summary": "I've started a new project to collect and document Agentic Engineering Patterns - coding practices and patterns to help get the best results out of this new era of coding agent development we find ourselves entering. I'm using Agentic Engineering to refer to building software using coding agents - tools like Claude Code and OpenAI Codex, where the defining feature is that they can both generate and execute code - allowing them to test that code and iterate on it independently of turn-by-turn guidance from their human supervisor. I think of vibe coding using its original definition of coding where you pay no attention to the code at all, which today is often associated with non-programmers using LLMs to write code. Agentic Engineering represents the other end of the scale: professional software engineers using coding agents to improve and accelerate their work by amplifying their existing expertise. There is so much to learn and explore about this new discipline! I've already published a lot under my ai-assisted-programming tag (345 posts and counting) but that's been relatively unstructured. My new goal is to produce something that helps answer the question \"how do I get good results out of this stuff\" all in one place. I'll be developing and growing this project here on my blog as a series of chapter-shaped patterns, loosely inspired by the format popularized by Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software back in 1994. I published the first two chapters today: Writing code is cheap now talks about the central challenge of agentic engineering: the cost to churn out initial working code has dropped to almost nothing, how does that impact our existing intuitions about how we work, both individually and as a team? Red/green TDD describes how test-first development helps agents write more succinct and reliable code with minimal extra prompting. I hope to add more chapters at a rate of 1-2 a week. I don't really know when I'll stop, there's a lot to cover! Written by me, not by an LLM I have a strong personal policy of not publishing AI-generated writing under my own name. That policy will hold true for Agentic Engineering Patterns as well. I'll be using LLMs for proofreading and fleshing out example code and all manner of other side-tasks, but the words you read here will be my own. Chapters and Guides Agentic Engineering Patterns isn't exactly a book , but it's kind of book-shaped. I'll be publishing it on my site using a new shape of content I'm calling a guide . A guide is a collection of chapters, where each chapter is effectively a blog post with a less prominent date that's designed to be updated over time, not frozen at the point of first publication. Guides and chapters are my answer to the challenge of publishing \"evergreen\" content on a blog. I've been trying to find a way to do this for a while now. This feels like a format that might stick. If you're interested in the implementation you can find the code in the Guide , Chapter and ChapterChange models and the associated Django views , almost all of which was written by Claude Opus 4.6 running in Claude Code for web accessed via my iPhone.

      "summary": "Agentic Engineering Patterns > The biggest challenge in adopting agentic engineering practices is getting comfortable with the consequences of the fact that writing code is cheap now . Code has always been expensive. Producing a few hundred lines of clean, tested code takes most software developers a full day or more. Many of our engineering habits, at both the macro and micro level, are built around this core constraint. At the macro level we spend a great deal of time designing, estimating and planning out projects, to ensure that our expensive coding time is spent as efficiently as possible. Product feature ideas are evaluated in terms of how much value they can provide in exchange for that time - a feature needs to earn its development costs many times over to be worthwhile! At the micro level we make hundreds of decisions a day predicated on available time and anticipated tradeoffs. Should I refactor that function to be slightly more elegant if it adds an extra hour of coding time? How about writing documentation? Is it worth adding a test for this edge case? Can I justify building a debug interface for this? Coding agents dramatically drop the cost of typing code into the computer, which disrupts so many of our existing personal and organizational intuitions about which trade-offs make sense. The ability to run parallel agents makes this even harder to evaluate, since one human engineer can now be implementing, refactoring, testing and documenting code in multiple places at the same time. Good code still has a cost Delivering new code has dropped in price to almost free... but delivering good code remains significantly more expensive than that. Here's what I mean by \"good code\": The code works. It does what it's meant to do, without bugs. We know the code works . We've taken steps to confirm to ourselves and to others that the code is fit for purpose. It solves the right problem. It handles error cases gracefully and predictably: it doesn't just consider the happy path. Errors should provide enough information to help future maintainers understand what went wrong. It’s simple and minimal - it does only what’s needed, in a way that both humans and machines can understand now and maintain in the future. It's protected by tests. The tests show that it works now and act as a regression suite to avoid it quietly breaking in the future. It's documented at an appropriate level, and that documentation reflects the current state of the system - if the code changes an existing behavior the existing documentation needs to be updated to match. The design affords future changes. It's important to maintain YAGNI - code with added complexity to anticipate future changes that may never come is often bad code - but it's also important not to write code that makes future changes much harder than they should be. All of the other relevant \"ilities\" - accessibility, testability, reliability, security, maintainability, observability, scalability, usability - the non-functional quality measures that are appropriate for the particular class of software being developed. Coding agent tools can help with most of this, but there is still a substantial burden on the developer driving those tools to ensure that the produced code is good code for the subset of good that's needed for the current project. We need to build new habits The challenge is to develop new personal and organizational habits that respond to the affordances and opportunities of agentic engineering. These best practices are still being figured out across our industry. I'm still figuring them out myself. For now I think the best we can do is to second guess ourselves: any time our instinct says \"don't build that, it's not worth the time\" fire off a prompt anyway, in an asynchronous agent session where the worst that can happen is you check ten minutes later and find that it wasn't worth the tokens.

      "summary": "Sometimes, I have 50 tabs open. Looking for a single piece of information ends up being a rapid click on each tab until I find what I'm looking for. Somehow, every time I get to that LinkedIn tab, I pause for a second. I just have to click on the little red dot in the top right corner, see that there is nothing new, then resume my clicking. Why is that? Why can't I ignore the red notification badge? When you sign up for LinkedIn for the first time, it's right there. A little red dot in the top right corner with a number in it. It stands out against the muted grays and blues of the interface. Click on it, and you'll discover you have a notification. It's not from someone you know; this is a fresh new account, after all. But the dot was there anyway. Add a few connections, give it some time, and come back. Refresh the page, and you'll have new notifications waiting. If your LinkedIn account is like mine, a ghost town, you still get the little red dot. My connections and I usually keep a few recruiters in our networks, an insurance policy in case we need to find work quickly. But we rarely, if ever, post anything. Yet whenever I log in, there's a new notification. Sometimes it's even a message, but not from anyone in my connections list. It's from LinkedIn itself. The little red dot isn't exclusive to LinkedIn. My Facebook account has been dormant for years, yet those few times annually when I log in, the notifications are right there waiting for me. I've even visited news websites where the little red dot appeared for reasons I couldn't understand. I didn't have an account, so what exactly were they notifying me about? That little red dot is a sophisticated psychological trigger designed to exploit the brain. It activates the brain's Salience Network . Think of it as a circuit breaker that alerts us to immediate threats. When triggered, it signals that the brain should redirect its resources to something new. The color red is not chosen by accident either. On my Twitter app, the notification is a blue dot, which I hardly ever notice (don't tell them that). But red triggers our brain to perceive urgency. We feel compelled to address it immediately. The little red dot fools us into believing that something trivial is actually urgent. Check your phone and you'll notice all the app icons with a little red dot in their top right corner. Most, if not all, social media alerts function as false alarms, and they gradually compromise our ability to focus on what matters. Whenever you spot the little red dot, you feel compelled to click it. It promises a new connection, a message, a validation of some sort. It doesn't matter that you are almost always disappointed afterward, because you will be presented with content that keeps you scrolling, never remembering how you got there. Facebook used to show the little red dot in their email notifications. When there is activity on your account, say you were tagged in a photo, Facebook sends you an email and in the top right corner, they draw a little red dot on the bell icon. Obviously, you have to click it so you don't miss out. There was a Netflix documentary released a few years ago called The Social Dilemma , an inside look at how social media manipulates its users. Whether intentional or not, their website featured a bell icon with a little red dot on it. You visit the site for the first time, and it shows that you have one notification. There's no way around it, you are psychologically enticed to click. A notification is supposed to be a tool, and a tool patiently waits for someone to use it. But the little red dot seduces you because it wants something from you. It's all part of habit-forming technology: the engagement loop. The engagement loop follows three steps: a cue (the notification), a routine (an action such as scrolling), and a reward (likes, a dopamine hit). From the social media platform's perspective, this is a tool for boosting retention. From the user's perspective, it's Pavlovian conditioning. For every possible event, LinkedIn will send you a notification. Someone wants to join your network. Someone has endorsed your skills. A group is discussing a topic. Each notification generates a red dot on your mobile device, pulling you back into actions that benefit LinkedIn's system. In the documentary, they show that this pattern is just the tip of the iceberg. Beneath the surface lies a data-driven, manipulative machine that feeds on our behavior and engineers the next trick to bring us back to the platform. For my part, I've disabled notifications from all non-essential apps. No Instagram updates, no Robinhood alerts, no WhatsApp group messages. I receive messages from people I know. That's pretty much it. For everything else, I have to deliberately seek out information. That said, I did see another approach in the wild. Some people simply don't care about notifications. Every app on their phone has a little red dot with the number \"99\" on it. They haven't read their messages and aren't planning to. You're lucky if they ever answer your call. I'm not sure whether this is a good or bad thing... but it's a thing. That little red dot represents something larger than a notification system. It's the visible tip of an infrastructure built to capture and commodify human attention. The addictiveness of social media isn't an unfortunate byproduct of connecting the world. Right now it's the most profitable business model. The more addictive the platform, the more you engage; the more you engage, the more advertisements you see. This addiction shapes behavior, consumes time, and affects mental wellbeing, all while companies profit from it.",

Colophon: All the rest. Deplatform yourself (permalink) The first time I met William Gibson – to interview him for the Globe and Mail on the release of 1999's All Tomorrow's Parties – there was one question I knew I wanted to ask him: \"What happens to the counterculture in the era of instantaneous commodification?\" https://craphound.com/nonfic/transcript.html Gibson's answer stuck with me for decades: What we're doing pop culturally is like burning the rain forest. The biodiversity of pop culture is really, really in danger. I didn't see it coming until a few years ago, but looking back it's very apparent. I watched a sort of primitive form of the recommodification machine around my friends and myself in the sixties, and it took about two years for this clumsy mechanism to get and try to sell us The Monkees. In 1977, it took about eight months for a slightly faster more refined mechanism to put punk in the window of Holt Renfrew. It's gotten faster ever since. The scene in Seattle that Nirvana came from: as soon as it had a label, it was on the runways of Paris. There's no grace period, so that's a way in which I see us losing the interstitial. This may seem like an odd thing to think about, but nearly all the art and culture that means something to me started as something that was transgressive and weird, and even if it was eventually metabolized by the mainstream, that was only after it had a chance to ferment and mutate in a tide-pool of Bohemian weirdness. All this century, I've asked friends and weirdos about what can resist this commodification and co-option. Scott Westerfeld – author of Uglies – had a very on-brand answer: he told me that he thought that teenagers might deliberately start cultivating acne as a badge of rebellion. That hasn't happened yet, but if it does, it will be born co-opted, because there's already a luxury brand called \"Acne\": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acne_Studios One anti-commodification measure that's worked reasonably well over the years is to be ugly. Punk zines and early Myspace pages embraced an aesthetic that the existing cohort of trained designers available to work for would-be co-opters would rather break their fingers than imitate. Eventually, some punk zinesters and Myspacers became freelance designers and offered the aesthetic for sale, but after the \"grace period\" that Gibson was worried about in 1999. By contrast, after a brief period in which early AI image-gen snuck psychedelic fish-dogs into every output, AI became so mid and inoffensive that even when it was used to make transgressive images (Trump spraying protesters with liquid shit from an airplane), it looked incredibly, terminally normal: https://pluralistic.net/2024/07/20/ransom-note-force-field/#antilibraries There's more than one way to be ugly, of course. The \"edgelords\" that defined forums like SomethingAwful and /b/ made heavy use of slurs, rape \"jokes\" and other beyond-the-pale rhetoric. Whether this reflected sincerely felt beliefs or a mere desire to shock (or both), it had the effect of making these subcultures very difficult to commodify. If you and your friends barely utter a single sentence that can be quoted in a mainstream news forum or office email, it's going to be very hard to co-opt you. For a long time, edgelords festered in the \"dark corners\" of the internet. But that's changed. The Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes – who thinks that \"every woman and girl\" should be \"sent to a gulag\" – has had dinner at the White House: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nick-fuentes-women-gulag/ Last week, Ryan Broderick wrote a short, striking article for his must-read Garbage Day newsletter about the way that the far right have become \"cool\" within Gen Z by being so outre that they were evicted from the major platforms (before Trump II, that is): https://www.garbageday.email/p/the-only-taboo-left-is-copyright-infringement As Broderick writes, \"cool\" isn't just \"trends\" (\"hyperpop, brainrot, crowdwork comedy, Instagram collages, their weird post-COVID pop punk exploration\"). For Broderick, cool things used to become trends after they were \"begrudgingly canonized\" by the likes of Time Magazine. But with Hollywood replaced by Youtube, magazines replaced by Tiktok, and radio replaced by Spotify, that looks very different today. Today's version of artist management teams is \"hype houses.\" All forms of cultural activity have collapsed into a single, overriding imperative: \"getting attention.\" Which brings Broderick to his main question: If everything is just attention now, and attention is completely commodified by algorithmic tech platforms, how can you push back against that? His answer: \"You have to essentially pre-deplatform yourself.\" For young people, \"the only things that have the level of scarcity and danger required to be seen as cool\" are \"whatever is unacceptable on those platforms.\" In other words, anything (and maybe only things) that're blocked or banned are a candidate to be cool. Cool people walk away from the places where you'd expect to find them and hang out in places that are culturally viewed as less important. Broderick argues that this is the source of far-right influencers' influence: the fact that manosphere weirdos and trolls are hanging out in \"shadowy corners\" like Kick makes them feel authentic and outside of the norm and thus intrinsically interesting. And (Broderick continues) the fact that these manosphere types are now totally reliant on Discord clip-farmers has made them feel more mainstream and thus potentially less interesting. This is where it gets cool. Broderick argues that there's nothing intrinsically reactionary about this kind of self-deplatforming is a parallel evolution taking place in progressive media. When Stephen Colbert's Trump-colonized network bans him from airing an interview with a Democratic politician, he puts it on Youtube instead, where it gets far more attention than it would have if the network had just left him alone. But by and large it's not Democratic politicians who are too dangerous for the platforms – it's copyright infringement. The law makes it very easy to get things removed via unproven accusations of copyright infringement, and the platforms make it even easier: https://pluralistic.net/2024/06/27/nuke-first/#ask-questions-never Copyright is a doctrine that, by design, has very fuzzy edges where things may or may not be prohibited. But in the digital world, those edges are often erased, even as the zone of lawful activity they enclose contracts. This means that media that can be accused of infringing copyright is the most unwelcome content on platforms. Broderick's theory predicts that the \"coolest\" media – the stuff that makes taste – is the stuff that fits in this zone of copyright infringement. He cites some compelling case studies, like Vera Drew's \"The People's Joker,\" an amazing, unauthorized Batman mashup/trans allegory. Warner shut down multiple screenings of The People's Joker (including at TIFF), and this increased the coolness and prominence of the movie, driving people to underground screenings: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_People%27s_Joker A more contemporary version is Nirvanna The Band The Show The Movie, which Broderick describes as \"a copyright rats nest\" based on a web series that is \"completely illegal to watch on streaming platforms\": https://pagesix.com/2026/02/14/hollywood/how-nirvanna-the-band-the-show-the-movie-skirted-copyright-law/ Despite this/because of this, NTBTSTM just had \"the biggest opening ever for a live-action Canadian film\": https://x.com/hertzbarry/status/2023521583923663342 Broderick's conclusion is that \"as platforms police speech less and less, edgelords lose their sheen,\" but that this material, at or beyond the edge of copyright, unwelcome on platforms, is the future face of cool. And here's where Broderick really got me: \"the most dangerous thing for platforms is not racist garbage. It’s unmonetizeable content.\" I make a lot of \"unmonetizable content,\" starting with this blog, which has no metrics, no analytics, and (of course) no ads. I refuse to add social media cards, and hide obscure jokes in incredibly long URLs that get truncated on social media. I labor for hours over the weird illustrations that go at the top of the posts, which I release (along with the text they accompany) under Creative Commons licenses that let pretty much anyone do pretty much anything with them, without asking me, telling me, or paying me (it's always very funny when someone accuses me of publishing this work as clickbait – clickbait for what? To increase bandwidth consumption at my server?). I do this to \"woo the muse of the odd,\" a phrase I lifted from Bruce Sterling's 1991 keynote for the Game Developers' Conference, a talk that struck me so hard that I dropped out of university to make weird multimedia shortly after reading it: https://lib.ru/STERLINGB/story.txt It's a great talk, but the best parts are where Sterling grapples with this question of coolness, counterculture, and commodification: In the immortal words of Lafcadio Hearn, a geek of incredible obscurity whose work is still in print after a hundred years, \"woo the muse of the odd.\" A good science fiction story is not a \"good story\" with a polite whiff of rocket fuel in it. A good science fiction story is something that knows it is science fiction and plunges through that and comes roaring out of the other side. Computer entertainment should not be more like movies, it shouldn't be more like books, it should be more like computer entertainment, SO MUCH MORE LIKE COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT THAT IT RIPS THROUGH THE LIMITS AND IS SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE! I don't think you can last by meeting the contemporary public taste, the taste from the last quarterly report. I don't think you can last by following demographics and carefully meeting expectations. I don't know many works of art that last that are condescending. I don't know many works of art that last that are deliberately stupid… Get weird. Get way weird. Get dangerously weird. Get sophisticatedly, thoroughly weird and don't do it halfway, put every ounce of horsepower you have behind it. It's been more than 30 years since I read that essay, more than a quarter century since I asked William Gibson whether Madison Avenue \"finds its own use for things.\" Over the ensuing decades, media has become ever-better at \"following demographics and carefully meeting expectations,\" thanks to vast troves of behavioral data correlated with media analytics. That process has only accelerated the \"recommodification machine\" that Gibson worried about in 1999, but as Broderick points out, there's one thing that is even harder to co-op than acne – \"unmonetizable content,\" the Kryptonite of the platforms.

      "summary": "Nvidia was only invited to invest. That is one reversal of commitment. Remember that graph that has been circling around for some time now? The one that shows the circular investment from AI companies: Basically Nvidia will invest $100 billion in OpenAI. OpenAI will then invest $300 billion in Oracle, then Oracle invests back into Nvidia. Now, Jensen Huang, the Nvidia CEO, is back tracking and saying he never made that commitment . “It was never a commitment. They invited us to invest up to $100 billion and of course, we were, we were very happy and honored that they invited us, but we will invest one step at a time.” So he never committed? Did we make up all these graphs in our head? Was it a misquote from a journalist somewhere that sparkled all this frenzy? Well, you can take a look in OpenAI press release in September of 2025 . They wrote: NVIDIA intends to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as the new NVIDIA systems are deployed. In fact, Jensen Huang went on to say: “NVIDIA and OpenAI have pushed each other for a decade, from the first DGX supercomputer to the breakthrough of ChatGPT. This investment and infrastructure partnership mark the next leap forward—deploying 10 gigawatts to power the next era of intelligence.” It sounds like Jensen is distancing himself from that $100 billion commitment. Did he take a peak inside OpenAI and change his mind? At the same time, OpenAI is experimenting with ads. Sam Altman stated before that they would only ever use ads as a last resort. It sounds like we are in the phase.",

      "summary": "Today's links A perforated corporate veil: The Brazilian method for curbing corporate power. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Social media turned US parties into host organisms for third parties; \"Citizens\" are hired actors; Insured exoskeletons; Talking with Snowden and Gibson. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. A perforated corporate veil (permalink) \"Capitalist realism\" is the idea that the world's current economic and political arrangements are inevitable, and that any attempt to alter them is a) irrational; b) doomed; and c) dangerous. It's the ideology of Margaret Thatcher's maxim, \"There is no alternative.\" Obviously this is very convenient if you are a current beneficiary of the status quo. \"There is no alternative\" is a thought-stopping demand dressed up as an observation. It means, \"Don't try and think of alternatives.\" The thing is, alternatives already exist and work very well. The Mondragon co-ops in Spain constitute a fully worked out, long-term stable economic alternative to traditional capitalist enterprises, employing more than 100,000 people and generating tangible, empirically measured benefits to workers, customers and the region: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation Proponents of capitalist realism will tell you that Mondragon doesn't count. Maybe it's just a one-off. Or maybe it's just not big enough. 100,000 workers sounds like a lot, but Amazon has over 1.5m employees and untold numbers of misclassified contractors who are employees in everything but name (and legal rights). This is some pretty transparent goalpost moving, but sure, let's stipulate that Mondragon doesn't prove that there are broadly applicable alternatives to the dominant capitalism of the mid-2020s. Are there other examples of \"an alternative?\" There sure are. Let's look at limited liability. Limited liability – the idea that a company's shareholders cannot be held liable for the company's misdeeds – is a bedrock of capitalist dogma. The story goes that until the advent of the \"joint stock enterprise\" (and its handmaiden, limited liability) there was no efficient way to do \"capital formation\" (raising money for a project or business). Because of this, the only ambitious, capital-intensive projects were those that caught the fancy of a king, a Pope, or an aristocrat. But once limited liability appears on the scene, many people of modest means can jointly invest in a project without worrying about being bankrupted if it turns out that the people running it are crooks or bumblers. That lets you, say, buy a single share of a company without having to keep daily tabs on the management's every action without worrying that if they go wrong, someone they've hurt will sue you for everything you've got. Capital formation is a real thing, and limited liability unquestionably facilitates capital formation. There are plenty of good things in the world that exist because limited liability protections allowed everyday people to help bring them into existence. This isn't just stuff that makes a lot of money for capitalism's true believers, it includes everything from the company that makes the printing presses that your favorite anarchist zine runs on to the mill that makes the alloys for the e-bike you use to get to a demonstration. This is where capitalist realism comes in. Capitalist realists will claim that there is no way to do capital formation for these beneficial goods without limited liability – and not just any limited liability, but maximum limited liability in which the \"corporate veil\" can never be pierced to assign culpability to any shareholder. The capitalist realist claim is that the corporate veil is like the skin of a balloon, and that any attempt to poke even the smallest hole in it will cause it to rupture and vanish. But this just isn't true, and we can tell, because one of the largest economies in the world has operated with a perforated corporate veil for nearly a century, and that economy hasn't suffered from capital formation problems. Quite the contrary, some of the world's largest (and most destructive) monopolies are headquartered in this country where the veil of limited liability is thoroughly perforated. The country I'm talking about is Brazil, which has had limited limited liability since 1937: https://lpeproject.org/blog/when-workers-pierce-the-corporate-veil-brazils-forgotten-innovation/ As Mariana Pargendler writes for the LPE Project, Brazil put limits on limited liability to address a common pattern of corporate abuse. Companies would set up in Brazil, incur a lot of liabilities (say, by poisoning the land, water and air, or by stealing from or maiming workers), and then, when the wheels of justice caught up with them, the companies would fold and re-establish themselves the next day under a new name. Like I say, this happens all over the world. It's incredibly common, and even the pettiest of crooks know how to use this trick. I know someone whose NYC apartment was flooded by the upstairs neighbor, who decided that they didn't need to worry about the fact that their toilet wouldn't stop running – for months, until the walls of the apartment downstairs dissolved in a slurry of black mold. The upstairs neighbor owned the apartment through an LLC, which they simply folded up and walked away from, while my friend was stuck with a giant bill and no one to sue. The limited liability company is the scammer's best friend. In the UK, an anti-tax extremist invented a tax-evasion scam whereby landlords pretend that their empty commercial buildings are tax-exempt \"snail farms\" by scattering around some boxes with a few snails in them: https://www.patreon.com/posts/149255928?collection=1941093 When this results in inevitable stonking fines and adverse judgments, the \"snail farmers\" duck liability by folding up their limited liability company after transferring its assets to a new LLC. Capitalist realists will tell you that this is just the price of efficient capital formation. Without total, airtight limited liability – the sort that allows for this kind of obvious, petty ripoff – no one would be able to raise capital for anything. Brazil begs to differ. In 1937, Brazil made parent companies liable for their subsidiaries' obligations, with a system of \"joint and several liability\" for LLCs. This was expanded with 1943's Consolidation of Labor Laws, and it worked so well that the Brazilian legislature expanded it again in 2017. Remember back in 2024, when Elon Musk defied a Brazilian court order about Twitter, only to have Brazil freeze Starlink's assets until Musk caved? That was the \"joint and several\" liability system: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/world/americas/brazil-musk-x-starlink.html As Pargendler writes, Brazil's liability system \"represented a distributive choice: prioritizing Brazilian workers’ ability to enforce their rights over foreign capital’s interest in minimizing costs through corporate structuring.\" Pargendler (who teaches at Harvard Law) co-authored a paper with São Paulo Law's Olívia Pasqualeto analyzing the impact that Brazil's limited liability system had on capital formation and corporate conduct: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=6105586 Unsurprisingly, they find that there has been a steady pressure to erode the joint and several system, but also that some countries (the US and France) have a \"joint employer\" doctrine that is a weak form of this. Portugal, meanwhile, adopted the Brazilian system, 70 years after Brazil – this transposition of law from a former colony to a former colonial power is apparently called \"reverse convergence\": https://lpeproject.org/blog/heterodox-corporate-laws-in-the-global-south/ More countries in the global south have adopted regimes similar to Brazil's, like Venezuela and Chile. Other countries go further, like Mozambique and Angola. Somewhere in between are other Latin American countries like Peru and Uruguay, where these rules have entered practice through judicial rulings, not legislation. The authors don't claim that perforating the corporate veil solves all the problems of exploitative, fraudulent or corrupt corporate conduct. Rather, they're challenging the capitalist realist doctrine that insists that this system couldn't possibly exist, and if it did, it would be a disaster. A hundred years of Brazilian law, and Brazil's globe-spanning corporate giants, beg to differ. (Image: Gage Skidmore, CC BY-SA 2.0, modified) Hey look at this (permalink) Rep.

      "summary": "A few years back, the term \"AI\" took an unexpected turn when it was redefined as \"Actual Indian\". As in, a person in India operating the machine remotely. I first heard the term when Amazon was boasting about their cashierless grocery stores. There was a big sign in the store that said \"Just Walk Out,\" meaning you grab your items, walk out, and get charged the correct amount automatically. How did they do it? According to Amazon, they used AI. What kind of AI exactly, nobody was quite sure. But customers started reporting something odd. They weren't charged immediately after leaving the store. Some said it took several days for a charge to appear on their account. It eventually came out that the technology was sophisticated tracking performed by Amazon's team in India. Workers would manually review footage of each customer's visit and charge them accordingly. This operation was impressive. Coordinating thousands of store visits, matching items to customers across multiple camera angles, and doing it accurately enough that most people never noticed the delay. But because it was buried under the \"AI\" label, the moment the truth came out, the whole thing became a punchline. In 2024, Tesla held their \"We, Robot\" event, where Optimus robots operated a bar. They were serving drinks, dancing, and mingling with guests. It was a pretty impressive display. The robots moved fluidly, held conversations, and handed off drinks without fumbling. Elon Musk claimed they were AI-driven , fully autonomous. People were genuinely impressed by the interactions, and for good reason. Fluid, bipedal locomotion in a crowded social environment is an extraordinarily hard robotics problem. The moment it came out that the robots were teleoperated, the sentiment flipped entirely. It didn't matter how dexterous or natural the movement was. It felt like a magic trick exposed. But think about what was actually being demonstrated. Humanoid robots walking through a crowd, responding in real time to a human operator's inputs, without tripping over guests or spilling drinks. That's not nothing. Slapping \"AI\" on it turned an engineering achievement into a scandal. More recently, the company 1X unveiled a friendly humanoid robot available for purchase at $20,000. The demo looks genuinely impressive. The robot can perform domestic tasks like doing laundry, folding clothes, and navigating a home environment. And if it doesn't know how to do something, it can be taught. You can authorize a remote worker to take control, demonstrate the task, and the robot learns from that demonstration, adding it to its growing repertoire. That's a legitimately interesting approach to machine learning through human guidance. What got glossed over is how much of the current capability relies on that remote worker. Right after the unveiling, the Wall Street Journal was invited to test the robots. In their video, the robot is being operated entirely by a person sitting in the next room. To be fair, the smoothness of that teleoperation is itself a technical achievement. Real-time control of a bipedal robot performing fine motor tasks, like folding a shirt, requires low-latency communication, precise motor control, and a well-designed interface for the operator. That's years of engineering work. But because teleoperation isn't the product being sold, AI is,that achievement gets treated as evidence of fraud. We've built an environment where \"teleoperated\" has become a slur, and anything short of full autonomy is seen as cheating. Even Waymo, whose self-driving cars have logged millions of autonomous miles, feels compelled to publicly defend themselves against accusations of secretly using remote operators. As if any human involvement would invalidate everything they've built. I think teleoperation is pretty impressive. It's a valuable technology in its own right. Surgeons use it to operate across continents. Industrial operators use it to work in places no human could safely go. In all of these cases, having a human-in-the-loop is the point. Every \"AI\" product that turns out to have a person behind the curtain makes the public more skeptical. In a parallel universe, there is a version of the tech industry that celebrates teleoperation as a stepping stone. Where we are building tools to make collaboration easier through teleoperation, and it's not viewed as an embarrassing secret.",

      "summary": "Today's links Six years of Pluralistic: Time flies when you're writing the web. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: MBA phrenology; Sony's DRM CEO is out; Midwestern Tahrir; Reverse Centaurs and AI. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Six years of Pluralistic (permalink) Six years ago today, after 19 years with Boing Boing, during which time I wrote tens of thousands of blog posts, I started a new, solo blog, with the semi-ironic name \"Pluralistic.\" I didn't know what Pluralistic was going to be, but I wasn't writing Boing Boing anymore, and I knew I wanted to keep writing the web in some fashion. Six years and more than 1,500 posts later, I am so satisfied with how Pluralistic is going. I spent a couple of decades processing everything that seemed interesting or significant through a blog, which created a massive database (and mnemonically available collection of partially developed thoughts) that I'm now reprocessing as a series of essays that make sense of today in light of everything that I've thought about for my whole adult life, which are, in turn, fodder for books, both fiction and nonfiction. I call this \"The Memex Method\": https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/09/the-memex-method/ \"The Memex Method\" is also the title of a collection of essays (from this blog) that I've sold to Farrar, Straus and Giroux, but that book keeps getting bumped because of other books I end up writing based on the work I do here, starting with last year's Enshittification. I'm now fully two books ahead of myself, with The Reverse Centaur's Guide to Life After AI coming in June, and The Post-American Internet in early 2027 (in addition to two graphic novels and a short story collection). Professionally speaking, these are the most successful books I've written, in a long, 30+ book career with many notable successes. Intellectually and artistically speaking, I'm incredibly satisfied with the direction my career has moved in over my six Pluralistic years. Blogging is – and always has been – a lot of work for me, but it's work that pays off, even if I don't always know what form that payoff will take. One essential part of this blog is my daily retrospective of posts from this day through my blogging history – 25 years ago, 20 years ago, 15 years ago, 10 years ago, 5 years ago, and last year. I used to call this \"This day in history\" but now I call it \"Object permanence,\" for the developmental milestone when toddlers gain the ability to remember and reason about things that have recently happened (roughly, it's the point at which \"peek-a-boo\" stops being fun). The daily business of reviewing and selecting blog posts from different parts of my life started as a trivial exercise, but it's become one of the most important things I do. I liken it to working dough and folding the dry crumbly edges back into the center; in this case, I'm folding all the fragments that are in danger of escaping my working memory back into the center of my attention. Six years ago, I didn't know what Pluralistic was going to be. Today, I still don't know. But because this is a labor of love, and a solo project, I get to try anything and either give it up or carry it on based on how it makes me feel and what effect it has on my life. I'm always tinkering with the format: this year, I also added a subhead to the Object Permanence section that tries to call out (in as few characters as possible) the most important elements of the day's list. I also dropped some things this year, notably, my \"linkdump\" posts. A couple years ago, at the suggestion of Mitch Wagner, I added a new section called \"Hey look at this,\" which featured three bare links to things I thought were noteworthy but didn't have time or inclination to delve into in depth. Later, I expanded this section to five. However, even with five bare links per edition, I often found myself with a backlog of noteworthy things. So I started writing the occasional Saturday \"linkdump\" essay in which I wove together the whole backlog into a giant, meandering essay. These made for interesting rhetorical challenges, as I found elegant ways to bridge completely disparate subjects – a kind of collaging, perhaps akin to how a mashup artist mixes two very different tracks together. Mentally, I thought of this as \"ringing the changes,\" but ultimately, I decided to drop these linkdump posts (for now, at least). They ended up being too much work, and of little value to me, because I found myself unable to remember what I wrote in them and thus to call them up to refer to them for future posts. Here's all 33 linkdumps; they're not gone forever (not so long as the links pile up in my backlog), but when they come back, they'll be in a different form: https://pluralistic.net/tag/linkdump/ This really is a labor of love, in the sense that I love doing it, and because it's hard work. The fact that it's hard work is a feature, not a bug. Working hard on stuff is really important to me, because when I am working hard, I gain respite from both physical and mental discomfort. As a guy with serious chronic pain living through the Trump years, I've got plenty of both kinds of discomfort. I can't overstate how physically and mentally beneficial it is to me to have an activity that takes me out of the moment. This year, I wrote several editions of Pluralistic from an infusion couch at the Kaiser Sunset hematology center in LA, where I was receiving immunotherapy for a cancer diagnosis that I'm assured is very treatable, but which – to be totally honest – sometimes gets my old worrier running hot: https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/05/carcinoma-angels/#squeaky-nail Making Pluralistic is several kinds of hard work. Over the past six years, I've become an ardent collagist, spending more and more time on the weird, semi-grotesque images that run atop every edition. Anything you devote substantial time to on a near-daily basis is something that gives you insight – into yourself, and into the thing you're doing. I've always had a certain familiarity with computer image editing (I think I got my start writing Apple ][+ BASIC programs that spat out ASCII art, before graduating to making pixel-art for Broderbund's \"Print Shop\"), but I've never applied myself to any visual field in a serious way, until now. Amazingly, after 50 years of thinking of myself as someone who is \"bad at visual art,\" I find myself identifying as a visual artist. I find myself pondering visual works the same way I think about prose – mentally tearing it apart to unpick how it is done, and thinking about how I could productively steal some new techniques for my own work. I'm also privileged to have some accomplished visual artists in my circle, like my pal Alistair Milne, who generously share technical and aesthetic tips. It's got to the point where I published a book of my art, and I think I'll probably do it again next year: https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/04/illustrious/#chairman-bruce There's also a ton of technical work that goes into publishing each edition of this newsletter. Things have moved on somewhat since I published an in-depth process-post in 2021, though I'm still totally reliant on Loren Kohnfelder's python scripts that help me turn the XML file I compose every day into files that are (nearly) ready to publish: https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/13/two-decades/#hfbd Much of the technical work is down to the fact that I'm still completely wed to the idea of \"POSSE\" (Post Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere): https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/19/now-we-are-two/#two-much-posse This means that after I write the day's post, I reformat it and republish it as a text-only newsletter, a Medium post, a Tumblr post, a Twitter thread and a Mastodon thread. This involves a ton of manual work, because none of the services I post to are designed to facilitate this, so I'm always wrestling with them. This year, all of them got worse (incredibly). Medium – where I used to have a paid column – has dropped its free-flag for my account, which now limits me to how many posts I can schedule. This doesn't come up often, but when I do schedule a post, it's generally because I'm going to be on a plane or a stage and won't be able to do it manually. There's no way I'm going to pay for this feature: I'm happy to give Medium my work gratis, but I will not and do not pay anyone to publish my work, and I never will. Tumblr did something to its post-composing text editor that completely broke it and I've given up on fixing it. I can't even type into a new post field! I have to paste in some styled text, then delete it, then start typing. It's ghastly. So now I just have a text file full of formatted HTML snippets and I work exclusively in the Tumblr HTML editor, pasting in blobs of preformatted HTML (including the florid, verbose HTML Tumblr uses for its own formatting) and then laboriously flip back and forth to the \"visual\" editor to see the parts that went wrong. Here's how busted that visual editor is: searching for a word then double-clicking on it does not select it. You have to click once, wait about 1.5 seconds, click again, wait again, and then you can select the word. Twitter has entered a period of terminal technical decline. I know, I know, we always talk about how fucked Twitter's content moderation is, for obvious and good reasons, but from a technical perspective, Twitter just sucks. If I make a post with an image and alt text in anticipation of later using it to start a thread, it often goes \"stale\" and will not publish until I delete the image and re-attach it and re-paste the alt text. Meanwhile, the thread editor is also decaying into uselessness. Fill in a 25-post thread and hit publish and, the majority of times, the thread publication will die midway through, displaying lots of weird failure modes (phantom empty posts at the end of the thread that need to be individually selected and deleted are a common one, but not the only one). The old Twitter's ability to add a new thread to an existing one has been dead for at least a year, so every post after the 25th stanza has to be manually tacked on to the previous one, which is made far harder by the fact that Twitter no longer reliably shows you the post you just made after it publishes. Mastodon still lacks a decent thread editor, one that has even the minimal functionality of Twitter circa 2020. Meanwhile, the Fediverse HOA continues to surface from time to time, with someone who's had a Masto account for ten seconds scolding me for posting threads – from my account whose bio starts \"I post long threads.\" It's genuinely tedious to be shouted at for \"using Mastodon wrong\" by someone who started using Mastodon yesterday (I opened my first Mastodon account in 2018!), and even worse when they double down after I point them to the essay I've written to explain why I post the way I do, and what to do if you want to read my work somewhere that's not your Mastodon timeline (\"Can you believe this asshole wrote a whole essay to explain why he posts his stupid Mastodon threads?\"): https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/16/how-to-make-the-least-worst-mastodon-threads/ Then there's email: I continue to love email, but email doesn't love me back. After years of being blackholed by AT&T and then Google, this turns out to be the year that Microsoft bounces thousands of messages to its Hotmail and Outlook users because they have arbitrarily and without warning added my mail-server to a blacklist. Thank you to the Fediverse friends who escalated my trouble ticket – but man, this is a headache I could certainly do without: https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/10/dead-letters/ My sysadmin, the incomparable and tireless Ken Snider, tells me that he's got the long-overdue new hardware installed at the colo and he's nearly ready to stand up my long-anticipated personal Mastodon server, which will let me solve all kinds of problems. He's also going to stand up my own Bluesky server, at which point I will part ways with Twitter. I wish I could have used the regular Bluesky service while I waited, but just setting up an account permanently binds you to totally unacceptable and dangerous terms of service: https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/15/dogs-breakfast/#by-clicking-this-you-agree-on-behalf-of-your-employer-to-release-me-from-all-obligations-and-waivers-arising-from-any-and-all-NON-NEGOTIATED-agreements What's the point of a service that has account- and data-portability if signing up for it makes you permanently surrender your rights, even if you switch servers? This might be the stupidest social media unforced error of the post-zuckermuskian era. There is one technology that has made my POSSE life better, and it might surprise you. This year, I installed Ollama – an open-source LLM – on my laptop. It runs pretty well, even without a GPU. Every day, before I run Loren's python publication scripts, I run the text through Ollama as a typo-catcher (my prompt is \"find typos\"). Ollama always spots three or four of these, usually stuff like missing punctuation, or forgotten words, or double words (\"the the next thing\") or typos that are still valid words (\"of top of everything else\"). The reason this is so valuable to me is that errors magnify through each stage of POSSE. Errors that make it through the python publication script take 10x the time to fix that they would if I caught them beforehand. Errors that I catch after running the scripts and publishing the posts take 10x time more. Errors that I have to fix later on – once I've closed all the relevant tabs and editors – take 10x again more time. Some POSSE channels (email, Twitter) can't be fixed at all. So catching these typos at the start of the process is a huge time-saver. I have some very generous readers who have the proofreader's gene and are very helpful in catching my typos (hi, Gregory and 9o6!), and I feel bad about depriving them of their fun, but there's still the odd error that slips through, and they always catch it. Ollama is a pretty good typo-catcher. Probably half of the \"errors\" it points out are false positives, which is better than the false positive rate for Google Docs' grammar-checker. As someone who uses a lot of jargon, made up words, etc in his prose, I'm used to overriding my text-editor. I wouldn't simply trust an LLM's edits any more than I would accept every suggestion from a spell-checker. Hell, yesterday I sent back a professionally copyedited manuscript (the intro for the paperback of Enshittification) and marked \"STET\" on about a third of the queries. Doubtless some of you are affronted by my modest use of an LLM. You think that LLMs are \"fruits of the poisoned tree\" and must be eschewed because they are saturated with the sin of their origins. I think this is a very bad take, the kind of rathole that purity culture always ends up in. Let's start with some context. If you don't want to use technology that was created under immoral circumstances or that sprang from an immoral mind, then you are totally fucked. I mean, all the way down to the silicon chips in your device, which can never be fully disentangled from the odious, paranoid racist William Shockley, who won the Nobel Prize for co-inventing the silicon transistor: https://pluralistic.net/2021/10/24/the-traitorous-eight-and-the-battle-of-germanium-valley/ Further, we wouldn't have the packet-switched network that delivered these words to you without the contributions of the literal war-criminals at the RAND corporation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET Refusing to use a technology because the people who developed it were indefensible creeps is a self-owning dead-end. You know what's better than refusing to use a technology because you hate its creators? Seizing that technology and making it your own. Don't like the fact that a convicted monopolist has a death-grip on networking? Steal its protocol, release a free software version of it, and leave it in your dust: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/samba-versus-smb-adversarial-interoperability-judo-network-effects That's how we make good tech: not by insisting that all its inputs be free from sin, but by purging that wickedness by liberating the technology from its monstrous forebears and making free and open versions of it: https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/14/contesting-popularity/#everybody-samba Purity culture is such an obvious trap, an artifact of the neoliberal ideology that insists that the solution to all our problems is to shop very carefully, thus reducing all politics to personal consumption choices: https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/31/unsatisfying-answers/#systemic-problems I mean, it was extraordinarily stupid for the Nazis to refuse Einstein's work because it was \"Jewish science,\" but not merely because antisemitism is stupid. It was also a major self-limiting move because Einstein was right: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-2-pro-nazi-nobelists-attacked-einstein-s-jewish-science-excerpt1/ Refusing to run an LLM on your laptop because you don't like Sam Altman is as foolish as refusing to get monoclonal antibodies because James Watson was a racist nutjob: https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/07/james-watson-remembrance-from-dna-pioneer-to-pariah/ Or to refuse to communicate via satellite because they were launched into space on a descendant of a rocket designed by the Nazi Wernher von Braun and built by slaves in a death camp: https://wsmrmuseum.com/2020/07/27/von-braun-the-v-2-and-slave-labor/4/ The AI bubble sucks. AI itself is a normal technology: https://knightcolumbia.org/content/ai-as-normal-technology It's not \"unethical\" to scrape the web in order to create and analyze data-sets. That's just \"a search engine\": https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/17/how-to-think-about-scraping/ There's plenty of useful things people can do with AI. There's plenty of useful things people will do with AI. AI is bad because it's an economic bubble and a grift, but not because we've created a bunch of utilities that would – under normal circumstances – be called \"plug-ins\": https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/05/pop-that-bubble/#u-washington I started blogging 25 years ago, just before the dotcom bubble popped. That bubble-pop inflicted a lot of pain on people who didn't deserve it, including the normie investors who'd been suckered into blowing their life's savings on dogshit stocks, and everyday workers who found themselves out of a job. But the world was better off. So was the web. With the bubble popped, real, good stuff could access talent, servers and office space. In the six years I've been doing this, I've seen several bubbles come and go: crypto, web3, metaverse. Now it's AI. But those bubbles were like Enron, frauds that left nothing good behind. AI is like the dotcom bubble, awash in sin and inflicting untold misery, but it will leave something useful behind: https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/19/bubblenomics/#pop And when it does, I'll make sense of it on this blog.
