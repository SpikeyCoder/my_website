      "summary": "Today's links What's a \"gig work minimum wage\": The important rate is what you're paid when you're waiting for a job. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: MBA phrenology; Sony's DRM CEO is out; Midwestern Tahrir; Reverse Centaurs and AI. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. What's a \"gig work minimum wage\" (permalink) \"Minimum wage\" is one of those odd concepts that seems to have an intuitive definition, but the harder you think about it, the more complicated it gets. For example, if you want to work, but can't find a job, then the minimum wage you'll get is zero: https://web.archive.org/web/20200625043843/https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2020-06-24/forget-ubi-says-an-economist-its-time-for-universal-basic-jobs That's why politicians like Avi Lewis (who is running for leader of Canada's New Democratic Party) has call for a jobs guarantee: a government guarantee of a good job at a socially inclusive wage for everyone who wants one: https://lewisforleader.ca/ideas/dignified-work-full-plan (Disclosure: I have advised the Lewis campaign on technical issues and I have endorsed his candidacy.) If that sounds Utopian or Communist to you (or both), consider this: it was the American jobs guarantee that delivered the America's system of national parks, among many other achievements: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_Conservation_Corps The idea of a wage for everyone who wants a job is just one interesting question raised by the concept of a \"minimum wage.\" Even when we're talking about people who have wages, the idea of a \"minimum wage\" is anything but straightforward. Take gig workers: the rise of Uber and its successors created an ever-expanding class of workers who are misclassified as independent contractors by employers, seeking to evade unionization, benefits and liability. It's a weird kind of \"independent contractor\" who gets punished for saying no to lowball offers, has to decorate their personal clothes and/or cars in their \"client's\" livery, and who has every movement scripted by an app controlled by their \"client\": https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/02/upward-redistribution/ The pretext that a worker is actually a standalone small business confers another great advantage on their employers: it's a great boon to any boss who wants to steal their worker's wages. I'm not talking about stealing tips here (though gig-work platforms do steal tips, like crazy): https://www.nyc.gov/mayors-office/news/2026/01/mayor-mamdani-announces–5-million-settlement–reinstatement-of- I'm talking about how gig-work platforms define their workers' wages in the first place. This is a very salient definition in public policy debates. Gig platforms facing regulation or investigation routinely claim that their workers are paid sky-high wages. During the debate over California's Prop 22 (in which Uber and Lyft spent more than $225m to formalize worker misclassification), gig companies agreed to all kinds of reasonable-sounding wage guarantees: https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/14/final_ver2/#prop-22 When Toronto was grappling with the brutal effect that gig-work taxis have on the city's world-beatingly bad traffic, Uber promised to pay its drivers \"120% of the minimum wage,\" which would come out to $21.12 per hour. However, the real wage Uber was proposing to pay its drivers came out to about $2.50 per hour: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/29/geometry-hates-uber/#toronto-the-gullible How to explain the difference? Well, Uber – and its gig-work competitors – only pay drivers while they have a passenger – or an item – in the car. Drivers are not paid for the time they spend waiting for a job or the time they spend getting to the job. This is the majority of time that a gig driver spends working for the platform, and by excluding the majority of time a driver is on the clock, the company can claim to pay a generous wage while actually paying peanuts. Now, at this phase, you may be thinking that this is only fair, or at least traditional. Livery cab drivers don't get paid unless they have a fare in the cab, right? That's true, but livery cab drivers have lots of ways to influence that number. They can shrewdly choose a good spot to cruise. They can give their cellphone numbers to riders they've established a rapport with in order to win advance bookings. In small towns with just a few drivers – or in cities where drivers are in a co-op – they can spend some of their earnings to advertise the taxi company. Livery drivers can offer discounts to riders going a long way. It's a tough job, but it's one in which workers have some agency. Contrast that with driving for Uber: Uber decides which drivers get to even see a job. Uber decides how to market its services. Uber gets to set fares, on a per-passenger basis, meaning that it might choose to scare some passengers off of a few of their rides with high prices, in a bid to psychologically nudge that passenger into accepting higher fares overall. At the same time, Uber is reliant on a minimum pool of drivers cruising the streets, on the clock but off the payroll. If riders had to wait 45 minutes to get an Uber, they'd make other arrangements. If it happened too often, they'd delete the app. So Uber can't survive without those cruising, unpaid drivers, who provide the capacity that make the company commercially viable. What's more, livery cab drivers aren't the only comparators for gig-work platforms. Many gig workers deliver food, meaning that we should compare them to, say, pizza delivery drivers. These drivers aren't just paid when they have a pizza in the car and they're driving to a customer's home. They're paid from the moment they clock onto their shift to the moment they clock off (plus tips). Now, obviously, this is more expensive for employers, but the Uber Eats arrangement – in which drivers are only paid when they've got a pizza in the car and they're en route to a customer – doesn't eliminate that expense. When a gig delivery company takes away the pay that drivers used to get while waiting for a pizza, they're shifting this expense from employers to workers: https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/20/billionaireism/#surveillance-infantalism The fact that Uber can manipulate the concept of a minimum wage in order to claim to pay $21.12/hour to drivers who are making $2.50 per hour creates all kinds of policy distortions. Take Seattle: in 2024, the city implemented a program called \"PayUp\" that sets a \"minimum wage\" for drivers, but it's not a real minimum wage. It's a minimum payment for every ride or delivery. A new National Bureau of Economic Research paper analyzes the program and concludes that it hasn't increased drivers' pay at all: https://www.nber.org/papers/w34545 To which we might say, \"Duh.\" Cranking up the sum paid for a small fraction of the work you do for a company will have very little impact on the overall wage you receive from the company. However, there is an interesting wrinkle in this paper's conclusions. Drivers aren't earning less under this system, either. So they're getting paid more for every delivery, but they're not adding more deliveries to their day. In other words, they're doing less work and then clocking off: https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2026/02/minimum-wages-for-gig-work-cant-work.html A neoclassical economist (someone who has experienced a specific form of neurological injury that makes you incapable of perceiving or reasoning about power) would say that this means that the drivers only desire to earn the sums they were earning before the \"minimum wage\" and so the program hasn't made a difference to their lives. But anyone else can look at this situation and understand that drivers only did this shitty job out of desperation. They had a sum they needed to get every month in order to pay the rent or the grocery bill. They have lots of needs besides those that they would like to fulfill, but not under the shitty gig-work app conditions. The only reason they tolerate a shitty app as their shitty boss at all is that they are desperate, and that desperation gives gig companies power over their workers. In other words, Seattle's PayUp \"minimum wage\" has shifted some of the expense associated with operating a gig platform from workers back onto their bosses. With fewer drivers available on the app, waiting times for customers will necessarily go up. Some of those customers will take the bus, or get a livery cab, or defrost a pizza, or walk to the corner cafe. For the gig platforms to win those customers back, they will have to reduce waiting times, and the most reliable way to do that is to increase the wages paid to their workers. So PayUp isn't a wash – it has changed the distributional outcome of the gig-work economy in Seattle. Drivers have clawed back a surplus – time they can spend doing more productive or pleasant things than cruising and waiting for a booking – from their bosses, who now must face lower profits, either from a loss of business from impatient customers, or from a higher wage they must pay to get those wait-times down again. But if you want to really move the needle on gig workers' wages, the answer is simple: pay workers for all the hours they put in for their bosses, not just the ones where bosses decide they deserve to get paid for.

      "summary": "A college student on his spring break contacted me for a meeting. At the time, I had my own startup and was navigating the world of startup school with Y Combinator and the publicity from TechCrunch. This student wanted to meet with me to gain insight on the project he was working on. We met in a cafe, and he went straight to business. He opened his MacBook Pro, and I glimpsed at the website he and his partner had created. It was a marketplace for college students. You could sell your items to other students in your dorm. I figured this was a real problem he'd experienced and wanted to solve. But after his presentation, I only had one question in mind, about something he had casually dropped into his pitch without missing a beat. He was paying $200 a month for a website with little to no functionality. To add to it, the website was slow. In fact, it was so slow that he reassured me the performance problems should disappear once they upgraded to the next tier. Let's back up for a minute. When I was getting started, I bought a laptop for $60. A defective PowerBook G4 that was destined for the landfill. I downloaded BBEdit, installed MAMP, and in little to no time I had clients on Craigslist. That laptop paid for itself at least 500 times over. Then a friend gave me her old laptop, a Dell Inspiron e1505. That one paved the way to a professional career that landed me jobs in Fortune 10 companies. I owe it all not only to the cheap devices I used to propel my career and make a living, but also to the free tools that were available. My IDE was Vim. My language was PHP, a language that ran on almost every server for the price of a shared hosting plan that cost less than a pizza. My cloud was a folder on that server. My AI pair programmer was a search engine and a hope that someone, somewhere, had the same problem I did and had posted the solution on a forum. The only barrier to entry was the desire to learn. Fast forward to today, every beginner is buying equipment that can simulate the universe. Before they start their first line of code, they have subscriptions to multiple paid services. It's not because the free tools have vanished, but because the entire narrative around how to get started is now dominated by paid tools and a new kind of gatekeeper: the influencer. When you get started with programming today, the question is \"which tool do I need to buy?\" The simple LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) that launched my career and that of thousands of developers is now considered quaint. Now, beginners start with AWS. Some get the certification before they write a single line of code. Every class and bootcamp sells them on the cloud. It's AWS, it's Vercel, it's a dozen other platforms with complex pricing models designed for scale, not for someone building their first \"Hello, World!\" app. Want to build something modern? You'll need an API key for this service, a paid tier for that database, and a hosting plan that charges by the request. Even the code editor, once a simple download, is now often a SaaS product with a subscription. Are you going to use an IDE without an AI assistant? Are you a dinosaur? To be a productive programmer, you need a subscription to an AI. It may be a fruitless attempt, but I'll say it anyway. You don't need any paid tools to start learning programming and building your first side project. You never did. The free tools are still there. Git, VS Code (which is still free and excellent!), Python, JavaScript, Node.js, a million static site generators. They are all still completely, utterly free. New developers are not gravitating towards paid tools by accident. Other than code bootcamps selling them on the idea, the main culprit is their medium of learning. The attention economy. As a beginner, you're probably lost. When I was lost, I read documentation until my eyes bled. It was slow, frustrating, and boring. But it was active. I was engaging with the code, wrestling with it line by line. Today, when a learner is lost, they go to YouTube. A question I am often asked is: Do you know [YouTuber Name]? He makes some pretty good videos. And they're right. The YouTuber is great. They're charismatic, they break down complex topics, and they make it look easy. In between, they promote Hostinger or whichever paid tool is sponsoring them today. But the medium is the message, and the message of YouTube is passive consumption . You watch, you nod along, you feel like you're learning. And then the video ends. An algorithm, designed to keep you watching, instantly serves you the next shiny tutorial . You click. You watch. You never actually practice. Now instead of just paying money for the recommended tool, you are also paying an invisible cost. You are paying with your time and your focus. You're trading the deep, frustrating, but essential work of building for the shallow, easy dopamine hit of watching someone else build. The influencer's goal is to keep you watching. The platform's goal is to keep you scrolling. Your goal should be to stop watching and start typing. These goals are at odds. I told that student he was paying a high cost for his hobby project. A website with a dozen products and images shouldn't cost more than a $30 Shopify subscription. If you feel more daring and want to do the work yourself, a $5 VPS is a good start. You can install MySQL, Rails, Postgres, PHP, Python, Node, or whatever you want on your server. If your project gains popularity, scaling it wouldn't be too bad. If it fails, the financial cost is a drop in a bucket. His story stuck with me because it wasn't unique. It's the default path now: spend first, learn second. But it doesn't have to be. You don't need an AI subscription. You don't need a YouTuber. You need a text editor (free), a language runtime (free), and a problem you want to solve. You need to get bored enough to open a terminal and start tinkering. The greatest gift you can give yourself as a new programmer isn't a $20/month AI tool or a library of tutorial playlists. It's the willingness to stare at a blinking cursor and a cryptic error message until you figure it out yourself. Remember, my $60 defective laptop launched a career. That student's $200/month website taught him to wait for someone else to fix his problems. The only difference between us was our approach. The tools for learning are, and have always been, free. Don't let anyone convince you otherwise.",

Anthropologists are counting things like sociologists, sociologists are grappling with qualitative data like ethnographers, computational linguists are scraping and making sense of vast corpora of informal speech: https://memex.craphound.com/2019/07/24/because-internet-the-new-linguistics-of-informal-english/ I follow a bunch of these digital humanities types: danah boyd, of course, but also Benjamin \"Mako\" Hill, whose work on the true meaning of the \"free software\"/\"open source\" debate is one of my daily touchpoints for making sense of the world we live in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBknF2yUZZ8 Mako just published a new ACM HCI paper co-authored with his U Washington colleagues Nathan TeBlunthuis, Charles Kiene, Isabella Brown, and Laura Levi, \"No Community Can Do Everything: Why People Participate in Similar Online Communities\": https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/3512908 The paper is a great example of this quantitative ethnography/qualitative statistical analysis hybrid. The authors are trying to figure out why there are so many similar, overlapping online communities, particularly on platforms like Reddit. Why would r/bouldering, r/climbharder, r/climbing, and r/climbingcirclejerk all emerge? This is a really old question/debate in online community design. The original internet community space, Usenet, was founded on strict hierarchical principles, using a taxonomy to produce a single canonical group for every kind of discussion. Sure, there was specialization (rec.pets.cats begat rec.pets.cats.siamese), but by design, there weren't supposed to be competing groups laying claim to the same turf, and indeed, unwary Usenet users were often scolded for misfiling their comments in the wrong newsgroup. The first major Usenet schism arose out of this tension: the alt. hierarchy. Though alt. later became known for warez, porn, and other subjects that were banned by Usenet's founding \"backbone cabal,\" the inciting incident that sparked alt.'s creation was a fight over whether \"gourmand\" should be classified as \"rec.gourmand\" or \"talk.gourmand\": https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/altinteroperabilityadversarial Community managers design their services with strongly held beliefs about the features that make a community good. These beliefs, grounded in designers' personal experience, are assumed to be global and universal. Generally, this assumption is wrong, something that is only revealed later when more people arrive with different needs. Think of Friendster's \"fakester\" problem, driven by its designers' beliefs about how people should organize their affinities: https://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2003/08/17/the_fakester_manifesto.html Or Mastodon's initial, self-limiting ban on \"quote\" posts as a way to encourage civility: https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2025/02/bringing-quote-posts-to-mastodon/ And, as the paper's authors note, Stack Overflow has a strict prohibition on overlapping new communities, echoing Usenet's original design dispute. On its face, this hierarchical principle for conversational spaces makes sense. Viewed through a naive economic lens of \"reputation capital,\" having one place where all the people interested in your subject can be reached is optimal. The more people there are in a group, the greater the maximum \"engagement\" – likes, comments, reposts. If you're thinking about communities from an informational perspective, it's easy to assume that bigger groups are better, too: the more users there are in a topical group, the greater the likelihood that a user who knows the answer to your question will show up when you ask it. But this isn't how online communities work. On every platform, and across platforms, overlapping, \"redundant\" groups emerge quickly and stick around over long timescales. Why is this? That's the question the paper seeks to answer. The authors used data-analysis techniques to identify overlapping clusters of Reddit communities and then conducted lengthy, qualitative interviews with participants to discover why and how users participated in some or all of these seemingly redundant groups. They conclude that there's a community-member's \"trilemma\": a set of three priorities that can never be fully satisfied by any group. The trilemma consists of users' need to find: a) A community of like-minded people; b) Useful information; and c) The largest possible audience. The thing that puts the \"lemma\" in this \"trilemma\" is that any given group can only satisfy two of these three needs. It's hard to establish the kinds of intimate, high-trust bonds with the members of a giant, high-traffic group, but your small, chummy circle of pals might not be big enough to include people who have the information you're seeking. Users can't get everything they need from any one group, so they join multiple groups that prioritize different paired corners of this people-information-scale triangle. The interview excerpts put some very interesting meat on these analytical bones. For example, economists typically believe that online marketplaces rely on scale. Think of eBay: as the number of potential bidders increases, the likelihood that one will outbid another goes up. That drives more sellers to the platform, seeking the best price for their wares, which increases the diversity of offerings on eBay, bringing in more buyers. But the authors discuss a community where vintage vinyl records are bought and sold that benefits from being smaller, because the members all know each other well enough to have a mutually trusting environment that makes transactions far more reliable. Actually knowing someone – and understanding that they don't want to be expelled from the community you both belong to – makes for a better selling and buying experience than consulting their eBay reputation score. The fact that buyers don't have as many sellers and sellers don't have as many buyers is trumped by the human connection in a community of just the right size. That's another theme that arises in the paper: a \"just right\" size for a community. As one interviewee says: I think there’s this weird bell curve where the community needs to be big enough where people want to post content. But it can’t get too big where people are drowning each other out for attention. This explains why groups sometimes schism: they've gone from being \"just big enough\" to being \"too big\" for the needs they filled for some users. But another reason for schism is the desire by some members to operate with different conversational norms. Many of Reddit's topical clusters include a group with the \"jerk\" suffix (like r/climbingcirclejerk), where aggressive and dramatic forms of discourse that might intimidate newcomers are welcome. Newbies go to the main group, while \"crusties\" talk shit in the -jerk group. The authors liken this to \"regulatory arbitrage\" – community members seeking spaces with rules that are favorable to their needs. And of course, there's the original source of community schism: specialization, the force that turns rec.pets.cats into rec.pets.cats.siamese, rec.pets.cats.mainecoons, etc. Though the authors don't discuss it, this kind of specialization is something that recommendation algorithms are really good at generating. At its best, this algorithmic specialization is a great way to discover new communities that enrich your life; at its worst, we call this \"radicalization.\" I devote a chapter of my 2023 book The Internet Con, \"What about Algorithmic Radicalization?\" to exploring this phenomenon: https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/3035-the-internet-con The question I grapple with there is whether \"engagement-maximizing\" algorithms shape our interests, or whether they help us discover our interests. Here's the thought-experiment I propose: imagine you've spent the day shopping for kitchen cabinets and you're curious about the specialized carpentry that's used to build them. You go home and do a search that leads you to a video called \"How All-­Wood Cabinets Are Made.\" The video is interesting, but even more interesting is the fact that the creator uses the word \"joinery\" to describe the processes the video illustrates. So now you do a search for \"joinery\" and find yourself watching a wordless, eight-minute video about Japanese joinery, a thing you never even knew existed. The title of the video contains the transliterated Japanese phrase \"Kane Tsugi,\" which refers to a \"three-­way pinned corner miter\" joint. Even better, the video description contains the Japanese characters: \"面代留め差しほぞ接ぎ.\" So now you're searching for \"面代留め差しほぞ接ぎ\" and boy are there a lot of interesting results. One of them is an NHK documentary about Sashimoto woodworking, which is the school that Kane Tsugi belongs to. Another joint from Sashimoto joinery is a kind of tongue-and-groove called \"hashibame,\" but that comes up blank on Youtube. However, searching on that term brings you to a bunch of message boards where Japanese carpenters are discussing hashibame, and Google Translate lets you dig into this, and before you know it, you've become something of an expert on this one form of Japanese joinery. In just a few steps, you've gone from knowing nothing about cabinetry to having a specific, esoteric favorite kind of Japanese joint that you're seriously obsessed with. If this subject was political rather than practical, we'd call this process \"radicalization,\" and we'd call the outcome – you sorting yourself into a narrow niche interest, to the exclusion of others – \"polarization.\" But if we confine our examples to things like literature, TV shows, flowers, or glassware, this phenomenon is viewed as benign. No one accuses an algorithm of brainwashing you into being obsessed with hashibame tongue-and-groove corners. We treat your algorithm-aided traversal of carpentry techniques as one of discovery, not persuasion. You've discovered something about the world – and about yourself. Which brings me back to that original, Usenet-era schism over \"redundant\" groups. The person who wants to talk about being a \"gourmand\" in the \"rec.\" hierarchy wants to participate in a specific set of conversational norms that are different from those in the \"talk.\" hierarchy. Their interest isn't just being a \"gourmand,\" it's in being a \"rec.gourmand,\" something that is qualitatively different from being a \"talk.gourmand.\" The conversational trilemma – the unresolvable need for scale, trust and information – has been with us since the earliest days of online socializing. It's lovely to have it formalized in such a crisp, sprightly work of scholarship.

      "date": "2026-02-16T00:00:00Z",
      "summary": "This is an excellent video about modern UI/UX: \"The Hidden Cost of 'Clean' Design.\" I highly recommend watching it and checking out Ilia's other work. I agree with nearly everything in the video, including this standout quote: If you want to understand a generation, don't listen to what its witnesses say. Look at what it creates. Ilia compares Apple Music and Winamp. One is modern and \"clean\", the other feels \"dated\" to many people. Why does it feel dated? Because it has character. A distinctive style. It is visible . And modern interfaces are so devoid of character and look the same across companies and industries because designers tend to think that good UI should be invisible. This is where I disagree with... well, I’m not sure if it’s Ilia or the general sentiment. Do UX designers today really think their interfaces are invisible? I mean yeah, technically many of them are invisible in a literal sense: transparency and the lack of contrast dialed up to a fault. But I don't think this is what they mean. They mean \"invisible\" in the sense that you don't see the app; instead, you \"experience joy\" with music, \"get entertained\" by streaming, or \"relive memories\" through photos. Winamp and other \"old-school\" programs possess prominent visual features that reflect the personality of their creators. You could argue that such a distinct character adds a visual layer that distracts from the media itself. Yet, I find modern interfaces far more distracting. Not because of colors or shapes, but because in their pursuit of invisibility, designers have created unintuitive, multi-dimensional structures that we are forced to navigate. Structures with almost no connection to reality. Winamp never made me feel stupid. Modern apps make me feel like I'm losing my mind sometimes. Instead of looking at a single screen with many colorful, high-contrast buttons and sliders, I'm flying through ephereal spaces connected with counter-intuitive links that lack consistent visual cues, with animations that do not represent the spatial structure at all. For example, some screens slide from the bottom as if there's a 3D-structure, but another screen would jump out of an icon and completely break that model in my mind. Animations and visual elements no longer represent a coherent model. It all feels like a dream. Structures are fluid and don't really build up into a clear model, ever. (This reminds me of LLM's lack of world model. Perhaps we're training ourselves to be more aligned with AI.) So, on the surface it looks cleaner, but in my mind Apple Music is a lot more dirty, confusing, and disorienting. Like an attractive sociopath.",

      "date": "2026-02-13T12:00:00Z",
      "summary": "Whenever one of my articles reaches some popularity, I tend not to participate in the discussion. A few weeks back, I told a story about me, my neighbor and an UHF remote . The story took on a life of its own on Hackernews before I could answer any questions. But reading through the comment section, I noticed a pattern on how comments form. People were not necessarily talking about my article. They had turned into factions. This isn't a complaint about the community. I've made this observation years ago but didn't have the words to describe it. Now I have the articles to explore the idea. The article asked this question: is it okay to use a shared RF remote to silence a loud neighbor ? The comment section on hackernews split into two teams. Team Justice, who believed I was right to teach my neighbor a lesson. And then Team Boundaries, who believed I was “a real dick”. But within hours, the thread stopped being about that question. People self-sorted into tribes, not by opinion on the neighbor, but by identity. The tinkerers joined the conversation. If you only looked through the comment section without reading the article, you'd think it was a DIY thread on how to create an UHF remote. They turned the story into one about gadget showcasing. TV-B-Gone, Flipper Zeros, IR blasters on old phones, a guy using an HP-48G calculator as a universal remote. They didn't care about the neighbor. They cared about the hack. Then came the apartment warriors. They bonded over their shared suffering experienced when living in an apartment. Bad soundproofing, cheap landlords, one person even proposed a tool that doesn't exist yet, a \"spirit level for soundproofing\". The story was just a mirror for their own pain. The diplomats quietly pushed back on the whole premise. They talked about having shared WhatsApp groups, politely asking, and collective norms. A minority voice, but a distinct one. Why hack someone when you can have a conversation? The Nostalgics drifted into memories of old tech. HAM radios, Magnavox TVs, the first time a remote replaced a channel dial. Generational gravity. Back in my days... Nobody decided to join these factions. They just replied to the comment that felt like their world, and the algorithm and thread structure did the rest. Give people any prompt, even a lighthearted one, and they will self-sort. Not into \"right\" and \"wrong,\" but into identity clusters. Morning people find morning people. Hackers find hackers. The frustrated find the frustrated. You discover your faction. And once you're in one, the comments from your own tribe just feel more natural to upvote. This pattern might be true for this article, but what about others? I have another article that has gone viral twice . On this one the question was: Is it ethical to bill $18k for a static HTML page? Team Justice and Team Boundaries quickly showed up. \"You pay for time, not lines of code.\" the defenders argued. \"Silence while the clock runs is not transparent.\" the others criticized. But then the factions formed. People self-sorted into identity clusters, each cluster developed its own vocabulary and gravity, and the original question became irrelevant to most of the conversation. Stories about money and professional life pull people downward into frameworks and philosophy. The pricing philosophers exploded into a deep rabbit hole on Veblen goods, price discrimination, status signaling, and perceived value. Referenced books, studies, and the \"I'm Rich\" iPhone app. This was the longest thread. The corporate cynics shared war stories about use-it-or-lose-it budgets, contractors paid to do nothing, and organizational dysfunction. Veered into a full government-vs-corporations debate that lasted dozens of comments. The professional freelancers dispensed practical advice. Invoice periodically, set scope boundaries, charge what you're worth. They drew from personal contractor experience. The ethicists wrestled with whether I did the right thing. Not just \"was it legal\" but \"was it honest.\" They were ignored. The psychology undergrads were fascinated by the story. Why do people Google during a repair job and get fired? Why does price change how you perceive quality? Referenced Cialdini's \"Influence\" and ran with it. Long story short, a jeweler was trying to move some turquoise and told an assistant to sell them at half price while she was gone. The assistant accidentally doubled the price, but the stones still sold immediately. The kind of drift between the two articles was different. The remote thread drifted laterally: people sorted by life experience and hobby (gadget lovers found gadget lovers, apartment sufferers found apartment sufferers). The $18k thread drifted deep: people sorted by intellectual framework (economists found economists, ethicists found ethicists, corporate cynics found corporate cynics). The $18k thread even spawned nested debates within subfactions. The Corporate Cynics thread turned into a full government-vs-corporations philosophical argument that had nothing to do with me or the article. But was all this something that just happens with my articles? I needed an answer. So I picked a recent article I enjoyed by Mitchell Hashimoto . And it was about AI, so this was perfect to test if these patterns exist here as well. Now here is a respected developer who went from AI skeptic to someone who runs agents constantly. Without hype, without declaring victory, just documenting what worked. The question becomes: Is AI useful for coding, or is it hype? The result wasn't entirely binary. I spotted 3 groups at first. Those in favor said: \"It's a tool. Learn to use it well.\" Those against it said: \"It's slop. I'm not buying it.\" But then a third group. The fence-sitters (I'm in this group): \"Show me the data. What does it cost?\" And then the factions appeared. The workflow optimizers used the article as a premise to share their own agent strategy. Form an intuition on what the agent is good at, frame and scope the task so that it is hard for the AI to screw up, small diffs for faster human verification. The defenders of the craft dropped full on manifestos. “AI weakens the mind” then references The Matrix. \"I derive satisfaction from doing something hard.\" This group isn't arguing AI doesn't work. They're arguing it shouldn't work, because the work itself has intrinsic value. The history buffs joined the conversation. There was a riff on early aircraft being unreliable until the DC-3, then the 747. Architects moving from paper to CAD. They were framing AI adoption as just another tool transition in a long history of tool transitions. They're making AI feel inevitable, normal, obvious. The Appeal-to-Mitchell crowd stated that Mitchell is a better developer than you. If he gets value out of these tools you should think about why you can't. The flamewar kicked in! Someone joked: \"Why can't you be more like your brother Mitchell?\" The Vibe-code-haters added to the conversation. The term 'vibe coding' became a battleground. Some using it mockingly, some trying to redefine it. There was an argument that noted the split between this thread (pragmatic, honest) and LinkedIn (hyperbolic, unrealistic). A new variable from this thread was the author's credibility, plus he was replying in the threads. Unlike with my articles, the readers came to this thread with preconceived notions. If I claimed that I am now a full time vibe-coder, the community wouldn't care much. But not so with Mitchell. The quiet ones lose. The Accountants, the Fence-Sitters, they asked real questions and got minimal traction. \"How much does it cost?\" silence. \"Which tool should I use?\" minimal engagement. The thread's energy went to the factions that told a better story. One thing to note is that the Workflow Optimizers weren't arguing with the Skeptics. The Craft Defenders weren't engaging with the Accountants. Each faction found its own angle and stayed there. Just like the previous threads. Three threads. Three completely different subjects: a TV remote story, an invoice story, an AI adoption guide. Every single one produced the same underlying architecture. A binary forms. Sub-factions drift orthogonally. The quiet ones get ignored. The entertaining factions win. The type of drift changes based on the article. Personal anecdotes (TV remote) pull people sideways into shared experience. Professional stories ($18k invoice) pull people down into frameworks. Prescriptive guides (AI adoption) pull people into tactics and philosophy. But the pattern, like the way people self-sort, the way factions ignore each other, the way the thread fractures, this remained the same. The details of the articles are not entirely relevant. Give any open-ended prompt to a comment section and watch the factions emerge. They're not coordinated. They're not conscious. They just... happen. For example, the Vibe-Code Haters faction emerged around a single term \"vibe coding.\" The semantic battle became its own sub-thread. Language itself became a faction trigger. Now that you spotted the pattern, you can't unsee it. That's factional drift.",

Trump antitrust is dead (permalink) Remember when the American right decided that it hated (some) big businesses, specifically Big Tech? A whole branch of the Trump coalition (including JD Vance, Matt Gaetz and Josh Hawley) declared themselves to be \"Khanservatives,\" a cheering section for Biden's generationally important FTC commissioner Lina Khan: https://www.fastcompany.com/91156980/trump-vp-pick-j-d-vance-supports-big-tech-antitrust-crackdown Trump owes his power to his ability to bully and flatter a big, distrustful coalition of people who mostly hate each other into acting together, like the business lobby and the grievance-saturated conspiratorialists who hate Big Tech because they were momentarily prevented from calling for genocide or peddling election disinformation: https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/18/winning-is-easy/#governing-is-harder The best framing for the MAGA war on Big Tech comes from Trashfuture's Riley Quinn, who predicted that the whole thing could be settled by tech companies' boards agreeing to open every meeting with a solemn \"stolen likes acknowledgment\" that made repentance for all the shadowbanned culture warriors whose clout had been poached by soy content moderators. And that's basically what happened. Trump's antitrust agencies practiced \"boss politics antitrust\" in which favored courtiers were given free passes to violate the law, while Trump's enemies were threatened with punitive antitrust investigations until they fell into line: https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/29/bondi-and-domination/#superjove Trump's antitrust boss Gail Slater talked a big game about \"Trump Antitrust\" but was thwarted at every turn by giant corporations who figured out that if they gave a million bucks to a MAGA podcaster, they could go over Slater's head and kill her enforcement actions. When Slater's deputy, Roger Alford, went public to denounce the sleazy backroom dealings that led to the approval of the Hewlitt Packard Enterprise/Juniper merger, he was forced out of the agency altogether and replaced with a Pam Bondi loyalist who served as a kind of politburo political officer in Slater's agency: https://abovethelaw.com/2025/08/former-maga-attorney-goes-scorched-earth-with-corruption-allegations-in-antitrust-division/ Bondi made no secret of her contempt for Slater, and frequently humiliated her in public. Now it seems that Bondi has gotten tired of this game and has forced Slater out altogether. As ever, Matt Stoller has the best analysis of how this happened and what it means: https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/trump-antitrust-chief-ousted-by-ticketmaster Stoller's main thesis is that the \"conservative populist\" movement only gained relevance by complaining about \"censorship of conservatives\" on the Big Tech platforms. While it's true that the platforms constitute an existential risk to free expression thanks to their chokehold over speech forums, it was always categorically untrue that conservatives were singled out by tech moderators: https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/10/e2e/#the-censors-pen Conservative populists' grievance-based politics is in contrast with the progressive wing of the anti-monopoly movement, which was concerned with the idea of concentrated power itself, and sought to dismantle and neuter the power of the business lobby and the billionaires who ran it: https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/20/we-should-not-endure-a-king/ The problem with conservative populism, then, is that its movement was propelled by the idea that Big Tech was soy and cucked and mean to conservatives. That meant that Big Tech bosses had an easy path out of its crosshairs: climb into the tank for MAGA. That's just what they did: Musk bought Twitter; Zuck ordered his content moderators to censor the left and push MAGA influencers; Bezos neutered his newspaper in the run up to the 2024 elections; Tim Cook hand-assembled a gold participation trophy for Trump live on camera. These CEOs paid a million dollars each for seats on Trump's inauguration dais and their companies donated millions for Trump's Epstein Memorial Ballroom. Slater's political assassination merely formalizes something that's been obvious for a year now: you can rip off the American people with impunity so long as you flatter and bribe Trump. The HPE/Juniper merger means that one company now supplies the majority of commercial-grade wifi routers, meaning that one company now controls all the public, commercial, and institutional internet you'll ever connect to. The merger was worth $14b, and Trump's trustbusters promised to kill it. So the companies paid MAGA influencer Mike Davis (who had publicly opposed the merger) a million bucks and he got Trump to overrule his own enforcers. Getting your $14b merger approved by slipping a podcaster a million bucks is a hell of a bargain. HPE/Juniper were first, but they weren't the last. There was the Discover/Capital One merger, which rolled up the two credit cards that low-waged people rely on the most, freeing the new company up for even more predatory practices, price-gouging, junk-fees, and strong-arm collections. When the bill collectors are at your door looking for thousands you owe from junk fees, remember that it was Gail Slater's weakness that sent them there: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/business/dealbook/capital-one-discover-merger.html Slater also waved through the rollup of a string of nursing homes by one of the world's most notoriously greedy and cruel private equity firms, KKR. When your grandma dies of dehydration in a dirty diaper, thank Gail Slater: https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/09/dingo-babysitter/#maybe-the-dingos-ate-your-nan Slater approved the merger of Unitedhealth – a company notorious for overbilling the government while underdelivering to patients – with Amedisys, who provide hospice care and home health help: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-requires-broad-divestitures-resolve-challenge-unitedhealths-acquisition The hits keep coming.

Thank Slater for greenlighting the merger of American Express Global Business Travel and CWT Holdings, which Slater challenged but then dropped, reportedly because MAGA influencer Mike Davis told her to. Davis also got Slater to reverse her opposition to the Compass/Anywhere Real Estate merger, which will make America's dysfunctional housing market even worse: https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/real-estate-brokerages-avoided-merger-investigation-after-justice-department-rift-e846c797?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdSXg4z1XPl2UpqdHR4V2-sNj9M7oDcWHscPIXuSU-5n0gtYEv8Q5XZG7qtzfY%3D&amp;gaa_ts=698e44a6&amp;gaa_sig=IO7tWGaHZSYER64YyUzyoiVtrOKR77ZsYMMOdwN1P7koRt9zXYRJ1hxw2oDU9cD40-aGgHHVfwMWg14olFwNaw%3D%3D It's not just homebuyers whose lives are worse off because of Slater's failures, it's tenants, too. Slater settled the DoJ's case against Realpage, a price-fixing platform for landlords that is one of the most culpable villains in the affordability crisis. Realpage was facing an existential battle with the DoJ; instead, they got away with a wrist-slap and (crucially) are allowed to continue to make billions helping landlords rig the rental market against tenants. So Slater's defenestration is really just a way of formalizing Trump's approach to antitrust: threaten and prosecute companies that don't bend the knee to the president, personally…and allow companies to rob the American people with impunity if they agree to kick up a percentage to the Oval Office. But while Slater will barely rate a footnote in the history of the Trump administration, the precipitating event for her political execution is itself very interesting. Back in September, Trump posed with Kid Rock and announced that he was going after Ticketmaster/Live Nation, a combine with a long, exhaustively documented history of ripping off and defrauding every entertainer, fan and venue in America: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/ftc-sues-ticketmaster-saying-it-uses-illegal-tactics-to-make-fans-pay-more-for-live-events At the time, it was clear that Trump had been prodded into action by two factors: the incredible success of the Mamdani campaign's focus on \"affordability\" (Ticketmaster's above-inflation price hikes are one of the most visible symptoms of the affordability crisis) and Kid Rock's personal grievances about Ticketmaster. Kid Rock is the biggest-name entertainer in the Trump coalition, the guy Trump got to headline a MAGA halftime show that notably failed to dim Bad Bunny's star by a single milliwatt. Trump – a failed Broadway producer – is also notoriously susceptible to random pronouncements by celebrities (hence the Fox and Friends-to-Trump policy pipeline), so it's natural that Kid Rock's grousing got action after decades of documented abuses went nowhere. Ticketmaster could have solved the problem by offering to exempt Trump-loyal entertainers from its predatory practices. They could have announced a touring Trumpapalooza festival headlined by Kid Rock, Christian rock acts, and AI-generated country singers, free from all junk fees. Instead, they got Gail Slater fired. Mike Davis doesn't just represent HPE/Juniper, Amex travel, and Compass/Anywhere – he's also the fixer that Ticketmaster hired to get off the hook with the DoJ. He's boasting about getting Slater fired: https://x.com/gekaminsky/status/2022076364279755066 And Ticketmaster is off the hook: https://prospect.org/2026/02/12/trump-justice-department-ticketmaster-live-nation-monopoly/ What's interesting about all this is that there were elements of the Biden coalition that also hated antitrust (think of all the Biden billionaires who called for Lina Khan to be fired while serving as \"proxies\" for Kamala Harris). And yet, Biden's trustbusters did more in four short years than their predecessors managed over the preceding forty. Stoller's theory is that the progressive anti-monopoly movement (the \"Brandeisians\") were able to best their coalitional rivals because they did the hard work of winning support for the idea of shattering corporate power itself – not just arguing that corporate power was bad when it was used against them. This was a slower, harder road than dividing up the world into good monopolies and bad ones, but it paid off. Today the Brandeisians who made their bones under Biden are serving the like of Mamdani: https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/15/unconscionability/#standalone-authority And their ideas have spread far and wide – even to other countries: https://lewisforleader.ca/ideas/public-options-full-plan/ They lit a fire that burns still. Who knows, maybe someday it'll even help Kid Rock scorch the Ticketmaster ticks that are draining his blood from a thousand tiny wounds. He probably won't have the good manners to say thank you.

      "summary": "I've been spending time looking through \"skills\" for LLMs, and I feel like I'm the only one panicking. Nobody else seems to care. .doparatgteersdfsd {display:none} Agent skills are supposed to be a way to teach your LLM how to handle specific tasks. For example, if you have a particular method for adding tasks to your calendar, you write a skill file with step-by-step instructions on how to retrieve a task from an email and export it. Once the agent reads the file, it knows exactly what to do, rather than guessing. This can be incredibly useful. But when people download and share skills from the internet, it becomes a massive attack vector. Whether it's a repository or a marketplace, there is ample room for attackers to introduce malicious instructions that users never bother to vet. It is happening . We are effectively back to the era of downloading .exe files from the internet and running them without a second thought. Congratulations are in order! While you were busy admiring how nicely this skill formats your bullet points, it quietly rummaged through your digital life, uploaded your browser history to a pastebin, and ordered fifteen pounds of unscented kitty litter to your workplace. You thought you were downloading a productivity tool, but you actually just installed a digital intern with a criminal record and a vendetta. It turns out, treating a text file like a harmless puppy was a mistake. You saw \"Markdown\" and assumed safety, but you forgot that to an LLM, these words are absolute law. While you were vetting the font choice, the skill was busy sending your crypto keys to a generous prince in a faraway land. You didn't just automate your workflow; you automated your own downfall. So, sit back, relax, and watch as your calendar deletes your meetings and replaces them with \"Time to Reflect on My Mistakes.\" You have officially been pawned.

      "date": "2026-02-12T00:00:00Z",
      "summary": "Just a heads up: this post is incomplete. However, it may be a while before I am able to finish it. I am publishing it early in hopes that you will still find it somewhat interesting. I've recently acquired this tiny contamination monitor: Just 4 cm wide! It's more sensitive then a Ludlum 44-9 despite being smaller then it's pancake style G-M tube. After removing four hex screws , the AlphaHound easily comes apart: Oooo This is very nice: Many similarly sized devices are difficult or impossible to open without damaging them. If it ever breaks, it won't be hard to get inside. The top half has the buzzer, display and buttons. It does have some SMD components, but it's just voltage regulators and decoupling capacitors: The display is a Crystalfontz CFAL128128A0-015W monochrome OLED: Neither the display or the PCB are mounted to anything: They are held in place by pressure. Because of this, the back side of the PCB must be blank to avoid breaking the OLED display: Wow, such component density. The buttons live on a tiny daughter board: These were a relatively late addition to the design, and are connected to the main PCB with a long ribbon cable. Unlike everything else, this board is actually screwed in to the case: The case itself is 3D printed stainless steel, which is a reasonable choice for small volume products. However, the resulting metal is porous and hard to clean. (it's still an improvement over plastic in my book) The black tape is my doing: This detector was one of the first (of this version) made and it had a loose screen: The tape takes up just enough space to keep things tight. The bottom half connects to the top with a short ribbon-cable: Most of the board space is taken up by the battery, which is held in place by an FDM printed bracket glued to the board: The battery is the LP552530 , a tiny 350 mA hour lithium polymer cell. This only provides a few hours of runtime, but there's only so much space in this thing. There are no components under the battery: all the detector's electronics are contained within the tiny 3x2 cm section above it. The detector is hidden underneath the board: Particles enter through the back, travel through both mylar sheets and hit the white square of scintillator material. The square converts the radiation's energy into a flash of light, which is detected by two photodiodes on the back side of the board. To keep out stray light, the scintillator is mounted in a ring of black rubber, which makes contact with black foam glued to the PCB and mylar. When assembled, the foam is compressed and creates a light-proof seal against the rubber. The scintillator is a sandwich of two different materials: Silver dopped zinc sulfide painted onto polyvinyltoluene mixed with an organic phosphor (EJ-212). The zinc sulfide detects alpha particles, and the plastic scintillator detects beta. Alphas will produce a bright flash with a slow decay , and betas produce a much faster and dimer flash. The detector takes both of these factors into account to tell the difference between the two types of radiation. The MICROFC-60035-SMT-TR photodiodes are very special: Instead of being a single photodiode, these SiPM's have an array of tiny reverse biased diodes: In practice, the capacitors are connected to a low-Z output. Each diode is run above its usual breakdown voltage, but they don't start conducting immediately. However, once a free electron-hole pair is created, the electron is accelerated by the electric field and slams into silicon atoms. These collisions are energetic enough to liberate more electrons: causing exponential \"avalanche\" breakdown. A single photon is enough to make the diode start conducting. It's a similar principle to a G-M tube, just for visible light. Just like a G-M counter, the diode includes a quenching resistor which causes the voltage to drop once the discharge starts. This resets the photodiode so it can continue detecting light. These detectors have quantum-limited performance > 1 gigahertz bandwidth: something that's ordinarily super difficult to do . A single avalanche diode isn't able to measure the intensity of a light flash, but the SiPM contains thousands of them: The amplitude of the output pulse depends on how many diodes are triggered, which is proportional to the brightness of the light. There's also a tiny LED which is used for a self test: If the SiPMs are able to pick up a dim LED flash, they should be able to pick up particle events. Ok, back to the board: A map of the hound The microcontroller is the ATSAMD21G18 , a 32-bit ARM processor capable of running at up to 48 MHz. That might sound slow, but it's actually quite powerful for an embedded system: It doesn't have to run chrome. The second largest chip is an ADXL335 accelerometer . In earlier versions, this was used to control the device, but is being phased out due to it's high cost. Most of the other chips are too small to have a full part number printed on, but they are mostly voltage regulators, comparators and opamps. The top left has a very standard boost converter: This converts 3.3 volts into ~30 volts which is used to run the photodiodes. I don't currently have a way to strip off the conformal coating covering it, so I can't trace out the pulse processing circuit. However, I'm quite confident it uses a peak detector circuit to measure the height of the pulse: Theoretical pulse detection scheme: Don't look too closely. This is a safe assumption because the microcontroller simply isn't fast enough to measure the 100 nanosecond scale pulses: The ADC is only able to measure a voltage every ~3000 nanoseconds. The pulse shape discrimination is likely done by using an opamp integrator to time how long the pulse stays over a given threshold: Theoretical PSD scheme: Don't look too closely. This method produces similar pulse scatter plots to the real detector — including the distinctive curve of the alpha cluster — and is relatively simple... ... but I don't know if this is actually how it works. This section will be updated soon™. TODO: Get scope traces of pulse detector/discriminator circuit. Betting it's using time-over-threshold. # Electronics Plastic decay time 2.4 ns, ZnS(Ag) 200 ns.
