              <strong>Service Description:</strong> Armstrong HoldCo LLC (the "Coach") provides interview preparation and career coaching services. While the Coach leverages experience from roles at Amazon and SpaceX, these services are independent and not affiliated with, or endorsed by, those entities.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Consultation Policy:</strong> New clients are eligible for one (1) complimentary 30-minute introductory consultation. This session is intended for goal alignment and fit assessment; it is not a formal coaching or mock interview session. The Coach reserves the right to decline consultations based on candidate profile or availability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Payment and Booking:</strong> All paid sessions ($75 per 30 minutes / $150 per hour) must be paid in full at the time of booking via the approved Stripe payment link. Bookings are not confirmed until payment is processed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cancellation and Rescheduling:</strong> Client must provide at least 24 hours' notice to cancel or reschedule a session. Sessions cancelled, or requests made to reschedule, with less than 24 hours' notice will be forfeited without a refund. One (1) emergency reschedule may be granted at the Coach's sole discretion. Late arrivals will not result in a session extension.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No-Guarantee Disclaimer:</strong> Coaching provides professional frameworks and feedback. The Coach does not guarantee job offers, specific interview scores, or employment outcomes. The Client is solely responsible for their performance in any third-party interview process.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> All proprietary materials, case study diagrams, and rubrics shared during sessions are for the Client's personal use only. Recording of sessions, redistribution of materials, or public posting of coaching content is strictly prohibited without prior written consent.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Liability:</strong> To the maximum extent permitted by law, Armstrong HoldCo LLC shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, or consequential losses resulting from the use of these services.
