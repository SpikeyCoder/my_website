      "summary": "Today's links Trump antitrust is dead: The \"populist right\" was doomed to fail. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Premature internet activists; Privacy Without Monopoly; \"Broad Band\"; Yazidi supersoldiers; I was a Jeopardy! clue. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Trump antitrust is dead (permalink) Remember when the American right decided that it hated (some) big businesses, specifically Big Tech? A whole branch of the Trump coalition (including JD Vance, Matt Gaetz and Josh Hawley) declared themselves to be \"Khanservatives,\" a cheering section for Biden's generationally important FTC commissioner Lina Khan: https://www.fastcompany.com/91156980/trump-vp-pick-j-d-vance-supports-big-tech-antitrust-crackdown Trump owes his power to his ability to bully and flatter a big, distrustful coalition of people who mostly hate each other into acting together, like the business lobby and the grievance-saturated conspiratorialists who hate Big Tech because they were momentarily prevented from calling for genocide or peddling election disinformation: https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/18/winning-is-easy/#governing-is-harder The best framing for the MAGA war on Big Tech comes from Trashfuture's Riley Quinn, who predicted that the whole thing could be settled by tech companies' boards agreeing to open every meeting with a solemn \"stolen likes acknowledgment\" that made repentance for all the shadowbanned culture warriors whose clout had been poached by soy content moderators. And that's basically what happened. Trump's antitrust agencies practiced \"boss politics antitrust\" in which favored courtiers were given free passes to violate the law, while Trump's enemies were threatened with punitive antitrust investigations until they fell into line: https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/29/bondi-and-domination/#superjove Trump's antitrust boss Gail Slater talked a big game about \"Trump Antitrust\" but was thwarted at every turn by giant corporations who figured out that if they gave a million bucks to a MAGA podcaster, they could go over Slater's head and kill her enforcement actions. When Slater's deputy, Roger Alford, went public to denounce the sleazy backroom dealings that led to the approval of the HPE/Juniper merger, he was forced out of the agency altogether and replaced with a Pam Bondi loyalist who served as a kind of politburo political officer in Slater's agency: https://abovethelaw.com/2025/08/former-maga-attorney-goes-scorched-earth-with-corruption-allegations-in-antitrust-division/ Bondi made no secret of her contempt for Slater, and frequently humiliated her in public. Now it seems that Bondi has gotten tired of this game and has forced Slater out altogether. As ever, Matt Stoller has the best analysis of how this happened and what it means: https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/trump-antitrust-chief-ousted-by-ticketmaster Stoller's main thesis is that the \"conservative populist\" movement only gained relevance by complaining about \"censorship of conservatives\" on the Big Tech platforms. While it's true that the platforms constitute an existential risk to free expression thanks to their chokehold over speech forums, it was always categorically untrue that conservatives were singled out by tech moderators: https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/10/e2e/#the-censors-pen Conservative populists' grievance-based politics is in contrast with the progressive wing of the anti-monopoly movement, which was concerned with the idea of concentrated power itself, and sought to dismantle and neuter the power of the business lobby and the billionaires who ran it: https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/20/we-should-not-endure-a-king/ The problem with conservative populism, then, is that its movement was propelled by the idea that Big Tech was soy and cucked and mean to conservatives. That meant that Big Tech bosses had an easy path out of its crosshairs: climb into the tank for MAGA. That's just what they did: Musk bought Twitter; Zuck ordered his content moderators to censor the left and push MAGA influencers; Bezos neutered his newspaper in the run up to the 2024 elections; Tim Cook hand-assembled a gold participation trophy for Trump live on camera. These CEOs paid a million dollars each for seats on Trump's inauguration dais and their companies donated millions for Trump's Epstein Memorial Ballroom. Slater's political assassination merely formalizes something that's been obvious for a year now: you can rip off the American people with impunity so long as you flatter and bribe Trump. The HP/Juniper merger means that one company now supplies the majority of commercial-grade wifi routers, meaning that one company now controls all the public, commercial, and institutional internet you'll ever connect to. The merger was worth $14b, and Trump's trustbusters promised to kill it. So the companies paid MAGA influencer Mike Davis (who had publicly opposed the merger) a million bucks and he got Trump to overrule his own enforcers. Getting your $14b merger approved by slipping a podcaster a million bucks is a hell of a bargain. HP/Juniper were first, but they weren't the last. There was the Discover/Capital One merger, which rolled up the two credit cards that low-waged people rely on the most, freeing the new company up for even more predatory practices, price-gouging, junk-fees, and strong-arm collections. When the bill collectors are at your door looking for thousands you owe from junk fees, remember that it was Gail Slater's weakness that sent them there: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/business/dealbook/capital-one-discover-merger.html Slater also waved through the rollup of a string of nursing homes by one of the world's most notoriously greedy and cruel private equity firms, KKR. When your grandma dies of dehydration in a dirty diaper, thank Gail Slater: https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/09/dingo-babysitter/#maybe-the-dingos-ate-your-nan Slater approved the merger of Unitedhealth – a company notorious for overbilling the government while underdelivering to patients – with Amedisys, who provide hospice care and home health help: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-requires-broad-divestitures-resolve-challenge-unitedhealths-acquisition The hits keep coming. Want to know why your next vacation was so expensive? Thank Slater for greenlighting the merger of American Express Global Business Travel and CWT Holdings, which Slater challenged but then dropped, reportedly because MAGA influencer Mike Davis told her to. Davis also got Slater to reverse her opposition to the Compass/Anywhere Real Estate merger, which will make America's dysfunctional housing market even worse: https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/real-estate-brokerages-avoided-merger-investigation-after-justice-department-rift-e846c797?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdSXg4z1XPl2UpqdHR4V2-sNj9M7oDcWHscPIXuSU-5n0gtYEv8Q5XZG7qtzfY%3D&amp;gaa_ts=698e44a6&amp;gaa_sig=IO7tWGaHZSYER64YyUzyoiVtrOKR77ZsYMMOdwN1P7koRt9zXYRJ1hxw2oDU9cD40-aGgHHVfwMWg14olFwNaw%3D%3D It's not just homebuyers whose lives are worse off because of Slater's failures, it's tenants, too. Slater settled the DoJ's case against Realpage, a price-fixing platform for landlords that is one of the most culpable villains in the affordability crisis. Realpage was facing an existential battle with the DoJ; instead, they got away with a wrist-slap and (crucially) are allowed to continue to make billions helping landlords rig the rental market against tenants. So Slater's defenestration is really just a way of formalizing Trump's approach to antitrust: threaten and prosecute companies that don't bend the knee to the president, personally…and allow companies to rob the American people with impunity if they agree to kick up a percentage to the Oval Office. But while Slater will barely rate a footnote in the history of the Trump administration, the precipitating event for her political execution is itself very interesting. Back in September, Trump posed with Kid Rock and announced that he was going after Ticketmaster/Live Nation, a combine with a long, exhaustively documented history of ripping off and defrauding every entertainer, fan and venue in America: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/ftc-sues-ticketmaster-saying-it-uses-illegal-tactics-to-make-fans-pay-more-for-live-events At the time, it was clear that Trump had been prodded into action by two factors: the incredible success of the Mamdani campaign's focus on \"affordability\" (Ticketmaster's above-inflation price hikes are one of the most visible symptoms of the affordability crisis) and Kid Rock's personal grievances about Ticketmaster. Kid Rock is the biggest-name entertainer in the Trump coalition, the guy Trump got to headline a MAGA halftime show that notably failed to dim Bad Bunny's star by a single milliwatt. Trump – a failed Broadway producer – is also notoriously susceptible to random pronouncements by celebrities (hence the Fox and Friends-to-Trump policy pipeline), so it's natural that Kid Rock's grousing got action after decades of documented abuses went nowhere. Ticketmaster could have solved the problem by offering to exempt Trump-loyal entertainers from its predatory practices. They could have announced a touring Trumpapalooza festival headlined by Kid Rock, Christian rock acts, and AI-generated country singers, free from all junk fees. Instead, they got Gail Slater fired. Mike Davis doesn't just represent HPE/Juniper, Amex travel, and Compass/Anywhere – he's also the fixer that Ticketmaster hired to get off the hook with the DoJ. He's boasting about getting Slater fired: https://x.com/gekaminsky/status/2022076364279755066 And Ticketmaster is off the hook: https://prospect.org/2026/02/12/trump-justice-department-ticketmaster-live-nation-monopoly/ What's interesting about all this is that there were elements of the Biden coalition that also hated antitrust (think of all the Biden billionaires who called for Lina Khan to be fired while serving as \"proxies\" for Kamala Harris). And yet, Biden's trustbusters did more in four short years than their predecessors managed over the preceding forty. Stoller's theory is that the progressive anti-monopoly movement (the \"Brandeisians\") were able to best their coalitional rivals because they did the hard work of winning support for the idea of shattering corporate power itself – not just arguing that corporate power was bad when it was used against them. This was a slower, harder road than dividing up the world into good monopolies and bad ones, but it paid off. Today the Brandeisians who made their bones under Biden are serving the like of Mamdani: https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/15/unconscionability/#standalone-authority And their ideas have spread far and wide – even to other countries: https://lewisforleader.ca/ideas/public-options-full-plan/ They lit a fire that burns still. Who knows, maybe someday it'll even help Kid Rock scorch the Ticketmaster ticks that are draining his blood from a thousand tiny wounds. He probably won't have the good manners to say thank you.

      "summary": "Introducing GPT‑5.3‑Codex‑Spark OpenAI announced a partnership with Cerebras on January 14th . Four weeks later they're already launching the first integration, \"an ultra-fast model for real-time coding in Codex\". Despite being named GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark it's not purely an accelerated alternative to GPT-5.3-Codex - the blog post calls it \"a smaller version of GPT‑5.3-Codex\" and clarifies that \"at launch, Codex-Spark has a 128k context window and is text-only.\" I had some preview access to this model and I can confirm that it's significantly faster than their other models. Here's what that speed looks like running in Codex CLI: That was the \"Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle\" prompt - here's the rendered result: Compare that to the speed of regular GPT-5.3 Codex medium: Significantly slower, but the pelican is a lot better: What's interesting about this model isn't the quality though, it's the speed . When a model responds this fast you can stay in flow state and iterate with the model much more productively. I showed a demo of Cerebras running Llama 3.1 70 B at 2,000 tokens/second against Val Town back in October 2024 . OpenAI claim 1,000 tokens/second for their new model, and I expect it will prove to be a ferociously useful partner for hands-on iterative coding sessions. It's not yet clear what the pricing will look like for this new model. Tags: ai , openai , generative-ai , llms , cerebras , pelican-riding-a-bicycle , llm-release , codex-cli",

      "summary": "Covering electricity price increases from our data centers One of the sub-threads of the AI energy usage discourse has been the impact new data centers have on the cost of electricity to nearby residents. Here's detailed analysis from Bloomberg in September reporting \"Wholesale electricity costs as much as 267% more than it did five years ago in areas near data centers\". Anthropic appear to be taking on this aspect of the problem directly, promising to cover 100% of necessary grid upgrade costs and also saying: We will work to bring net-new power generation online to match our data centers’ electricity needs. Where new generation isn’t online, we’ll work with utilities and external experts to estimate and cover demand-driven price effects from our data centers. I look forward to genuine energy industry experts picking this apart to judge if it will actually have the claimed impact on consumers. As always, I remain frustrated at the refusal of the major AI labs to fully quantify their energy usage. The best data we've had on this still comes from Mistral's report last July and even that lacked key data such as the breakdown between energy usage for training vs inference.

      "summary": "Today's links Doctors' union may yet save the NHS from Palantir: There is power in the union. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Premature internet activists; Privacy Without Monopoly; \"Broad Band\"; Yazidi supersoldiers; I was a Jeopardy! clue. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Doctors' union may yet save the NHS from Palantir (permalink) If you weren't paying close attention, you might think that the most grotesque and indefensible aspect of Keir Starmer's Labour government turning over NHS patient records to the American military contractor Palantir is that Palantir are Trumpist war-criminals, \"founded to kill communists\": https://www.thecanary.co/trending/2026/01/07/palantir-kill-communists/ And that is indeed grotesque and indefensible, and should have been grounds for Starmer being forced to resign as PM long before it became apparent that he stuffed his government with Epstein's enablers and chums: https://www.thenational.scot/news/25451640.streeting-defends-peter-mandelsons-relationship-jeffrey-epstein/ But it's actually much worse than that! It's not just that Labour hand over Britain's crown jewels to rapacious international criminals who are deeply embedded in a regime that has directly threatened the sovereignty of the UK. They also passed up a proven, advanced, open, safe, British alternative: the OpenSAFELY initiative, developed by Ben Goldacre and his team at Jesus College Oxford: https://www.opensafely.org/ OpenSAFELY is the latest iteration of Goldacre's Trusted Research Environment (TRE), arguably the most successful patient record research tool ever conceived. It's built atop a special server that can send queries to each NHS trust, without ever directly accessing any patient data. Researchers formulate a research question – say, an inquiry into the demographics of the comorbidities of a given disease – and publish it using a modified MySQL syntax on a public git server. Other researchers peer-review the query, assessing it for rigour, and then the TRE farms that query out to each NHS trust, then aggregates all the responses and publishes it, either immediately or after a set period. This is a fully privacy-preserving, extremely low-cost, rapid way for researchers to run queries against the full load of NHS patient records, and holy shit does it ever work. By coincidence, it went online just prior to the pandemic, and it enabled an absolute string of blockbuster papers on covid, dozens of them, including several in leading journals like Nature: https://www.digitalhealth.net/2022/04/goldacre-trusted-research-environments/ This led HMG to commission Goldacre to produce a report on the use of TREs as the permanent, principal way for medical researchers to mine NHS data (disclosure: I was interviewed for this report): https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/better-broader-safer-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis This is a near-miraculous system: an ultra-effective, ultra-cost-effective, Made-in-Britain, open, transparent, privacy-preserving, rigorous way to produce medical research insights at scale, which could be perfected in the UK and then exported to the world, getting better every time a new partner signs on and helps shoulder the work of maintaining and improving the free/open source software that powers it. OpenSAFELY was the obvious contender for NHS research. But it wasn't the only one: in the other corner was Palantir, a shady American company best known for helping cops and spies victimise people on the basis of dodgy statistics. Palantir blitzed Westminster with expensive PR and lobbying, and embarked on a strategy to \"hoover up\" every small NHS contractor until Palantir was the last company standing. Palantir UK boss Louis Moseley called it \"Buying our way in\": https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/01/the-palantir-will-see-you-now/#public-private-partnership It worked. First, Palantir got £60m worth of no-bid contracts during the acute phase of the pandemic, and then it bootstrapped that into a £330m contract to handle all the NHS England data: https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/22/palantir_wins_nhs_contract/ It was a huge win for corruption over excellence and corporate surveillance over privacy. At the same time, it was a terrible blow to UK technological sovereignty, and long-term trust in the NHS. But that's not where it ended. Palantir continued its wildly profitable, highly public programme of collaborating with fascists – especially Trump's ICE kill/snatch-squads – further trashing its reputation around the world. It's now got so bad that the British Medical Association (BMA) – a union representing more than 200,000 UK doctors – has told its members that they should not use the Palantir products that the NHS has forced onto their practices: https://www.bmj.com/content/392/bmj.s168/rr-2 In response, an anonymous Palantir spokesperson told The Register that Britons should trust its software because the company is also working with British police forces: https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/11/bma_palantir_nhs/ The BMA is a very powerful, militant union, and it has already run successful campaigns against Starmer's government that forced Labour to shore up its support for the NHS. The fact that there's a better, cheaper, more effective, technologically sovereign tool that HMG has already recognised only bolsters the union's case for jettisoning Palantir's products altogether.

      "summary": "I've been spending time looking through \"skills\" for LLMs, and I feel like I'm the only one panicking. Nobody else seems to care. .doparatgteersdfsd {display:none} Agent skills are supposed to be a way to teach your LLM how to handle specific tasks. For example, if you have a particular method for adding tasks to your calendar, you write a skill file with step-by-step instructions on how to retrieve a task from an email and export it. Once the agent reads the file, it knows exactly what to do, rather than guessing. This can be incredibly useful. But when people download and share skills from the internet, it becomes a massive attack vector. Whether it's a repository or a marketplace, there is ample room for attackers to introduce malicious instructions that users never bother to vet. It is happening . We are effectively back to the era of downloading .exe files from the internet and running them without a second thought. Congratulations are in order! While you were busy admiring how nicely this skill formats your bullet points, it quietly rummaged through your digital life, uploaded your browser history to a pastebin, and ordered fifteen pounds of unscented kitty litter to your workplace. You thought you were downloading a productivity tool, but you actually just installed a digital intern with a criminal record and a vendetta. It turns out, treating a text file like a harmless puppy was a mistake. You saw \"Markdown\" and assumed safety, but you forgot that to an LLM, these words are absolute law. While you were vetting the font choice, the skill was busy sending your crypto keys to a generous prince in a faraway land. You didn't just automate your workflow; you automated your own downfall. So, sit back, relax, and watch as your calendar deletes your meetings and replaces them with \"Time to Reflect on My Mistakes.\" You have officially been pawned.

      "date": "2026-02-12T00:00:00Z",
      "summary": "Just a heads up: this post is incomplete. However, it may be a while before I am able to finish it. I am publishing it early in hopes that you will still find it somewhat interesting. I've recently acquired this tiny contamination monitor: Just 4 cm wide! It's more sensitive then a Ludlum 44-9 despite being smaller then it's pancake style G-M tube. After removing four hex screws , the AlphaHound easily comes apart: Oooo This is very nice: Many similarly sized devices are difficult or impossible to open without damaging them. If it ever breaks, it won't be hard to get inside. The top half has the buzzer, display and buttons. It does have some SMD components, but it's just voltage regulators and decoupling capacitors: The display is a Crystalfontz CFAL128128A0-015W monochrome OLED: Neither the display or the PCB are mounted to anything: They are held in place by pressure. Because of this, the back side of the PCB must be blank to avoid breaking the OLED display: Wow, such component density. The buttons live on a tiny daughter board: These were a relatively late addition to the design, and are connected to the main PCB with a long ribbon cable. Unlike everything else, this board is actually screwed in to the case: The case itself is 3D printed stainless steel, which is a reasonable choice for small volume products. However, the resulting metal is porous and hard to clean. (it's still an improvement over plastic in my book) The black tape is my doing: This detector was one of the first (of this version) made and it had a loose screen: The tape takes up just enough space to keep things tight. The bottom half connects to the top with a short ribbon-cable: Most of the board space is taken up by the battery, which is held in place by an FDM printed bracket glued to the board: The battery is the LP552530 , a tiny 350 mA hour lithium polymer cell. This only provides a few hours of runtime, but there's only so much space in this thing. There are no components under the battery: all the detector's electronics are contained within the tiny 3x2 cm section above it. The detector is hidden underneath the board: Particles enter through the back, travel through both mylar sheets and hit the white square of scintillator material. The square converts the radiation's energy into a flash of light, which is detected by two photodiodes on the back side of the board. To keep out stray light, the scintillator is mounted in a ring of black rubber, which makes contact with black foam glued to the PCB and mylar. When assembled, the foam is compressed and creates a light-proof seal against the rubber. The scintillator is a sandwich of two different materials: Silver dopped zinc sulfide painted onto polyvinyltoluene mixed with an organic phosphor (EJ-212). The zinc sulfide detects alpha particles, and the plastic scintillator detects beta. Alphas will produce a bright flash with a slow decay , and betas produce a much faster and dimer flash. The detector takes both of these factors into account to tell the difference between the two types of radiation. The MICROFC-60035-SMT-TR photodiodes are very special: Instead of being a single photodiode, these SiPM's have an array of tiny reverse biased diodes: In practice, the capacitors are connected to a low-Z output. Each diode is run above its usual breakdown voltage, but they don't start conducting immediately. However, once a free electron-hole pair is created, the electron is accelerated by the electric field and slams into silicon atoms. These collisions are energetic enough to liberate more electrons: causing exponential \"avalanche\" breakdown. A single photon is enough to make the diode start conducting. It's a similar principle to a G-M tube, just for visible light. Just like a G-M counter, the diode includes a quenching resistor which causes the voltage to drop once the discharge starts. This resets the photodiode so it can continue detecting light. These detectors have quantum-limited performance > 1 gigahertz bandwidth: something that's ordinarily super difficult to do . A single avalanche diode isn't able to measure the intensity of a light flash, but the SiPM contains thousands of them: The amplitude of the output pulse depends on how many diodes are triggered, which is proportional to the brightness of the light. There's also a tiny LED which is used for a self test: If the SiPMs are able to pick up a dim LED flash, they should be able to pick up particle events. Ok, back to the board: A map of the hound The microcontroller is the ATSAMD21G18 , a 32-bit ARM processor capable of running at up to 48 MHz. That might sound slow, but it's actually quite powerful for an embedded system: It doesn't have to run chrome. The second largest chip is an ADXL335 accelerometer . In earlier versions, this was used to control the device, but is being phased out due to it's high cost. Most of the other chips are too small to have a full part number printed on, but they are mostly voltage regulators, comparators and opamps. The top left has a very standard boost converter: This converts 3.3 volts into ~30 volts which is used to run the photodiodes. I don't currently have a way to strip off the conformal coating covering it, so I can't trace out the pulse processing circuit. However, I'm quite confident it uses a peak detector circuit to measure the height of the pulse: Theoretical pulse detection scheme: Don't look too closely. This is a safe assumption because the microcontroller simply isn't fast enough to measure the 100 nanosecond scale pulses: The ADC is only able to measure a voltage every ~3000 nanoseconds. The pulse shape discrimination is likely done by using an opamp integrator to time how long the pulse stays over a given threshold: Theoretical PSD scheme: Don't look too closely. This method produces similar pulse scatter plots to the real detector — including the distinctive curve of the alpha cluster — and is relatively simple... ... but I don't know if this is actually how it works. This section will be updated soon™. TODO: Get scope traces of pulse detector/discriminator circuit. Betting it's using time-over-threshold. # Electronics Plastic decay time 2.4 ns, ZnS(Ag) 200 ns.

      "date": "2026-02-11T12:00:00Z",
      "summary": "Last year, all my non-programmer friends were building apps. Yet today, those apps are nowhere to be found. Everyone followed the ads. They signed up for Lovable and all the fancy app-building services that exist. My LinkedIn feed was filled with PMs who had discovered new powers. Some posted bullet-point lists of \"things to do to be successful with AI.\" \"Don't work hard, work smart,\" they said, as if it were a deep insight. I must admit, I was a bit jealous. With a full-time job, I don't get to work on my cool side project, which has collected enough dust to turn into a dune. There's probably a little mouse living inside. I'll call him Muad'Dib. What was I talking about? Right. The apps. Today, my friends are silent. I still see the occasional post on LinkedIn, but they don't garner the engagement they used to. The app-building AI services still exist, but their customers have paused their subscriptions. Here's a conversation I had recently. A friend had \"vibe-coded\" an Android app. A platform for building communities around common interests. Biking enthusiasts could start a biking community. Cooking fans could gather around recipes. It was a neat idea. While using the app on his phone, swiping through different pages and watching the slick animations, I felt a bit jealous. Then I asked: \"So where is the data stored?\" \"It's stored on the app,\" he replied. \"I mean, all the user data,\" I pressed. \"Do you use a database on AWS, or any service like that?\" We went back and forth while I tried to clarify my question. His vibe-knowing started to show its limits. I felt some relief, my job was safe for now. Joking aside, we talked about servers, app architecture, and even GDPR compliance. These weren't things the AI builder had prepared him for. This conversation happens often now when I check in on friends who vibe-coded their way into developing an app or website. They felt on top of the world when they were getting started. But then they got stuck. An error message they couldn't debug. The service generating gibberish. Requests the AI couldn't understand. How do you build the backend of an app when you don't know what a backend is? And when the tool asks you to sign up for Google Cloud and start paying monthly fees, what are you supposed to do? Another friend wanted to build a newsletter. Right now, ChatGPT told him to set up WordPress and learn about SMTP. These are all good things to learn, but the \"S\" in SMTP is a lie. It's not that simple. I've been trying to explain to him why the email he is sending from the command line is not reaching his gmail. The AI services that promise to build applications are great at making a storefront you don't want to modify. The moment you start customizing, you run into problems. That's why all Lovable websites look exactly the same. These services continue to exist. The marketing is still effective. But few people end up with a product that actually solves their problems. My friends spent money on these services. They were excited to see a polished brochure. The problem is, they didn't know what it takes to actually run an app. The AI tools are amazing at generating the visible 20% of an app. But the remaining invisible 80% is where the actual work is. The infrastructure, the security, maintenance, scaling issues, and then the actual cost. The free tier on AWS doesn't last forever. And neither does your enthusiasm when you start paying $200/month for a hobby project. My friends' experiments weren't failures. They learned something valuable. Some now understand why developers get paid what they do. Some even started taking programming bootcamp. But the rest have moved on. Their app sits dormant in an abandoned github repo. Their domain will probably expire this year. They're back to their day jobs, a little wiser about the difference between a demo and a product. Their LinkedIn profiles are quieter now, they have stopped posting about \"working smart, not hard.\" As for me, I should probably check on Muad'Dib. That side project isn't going to build itself.

      "summary": "Today's links Europe takes a big step towards a post-dollar world: Recapturing $24t worth of transactions from Visa/Mastercard. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: API for Congress; Steampunk fetish mask; Hillary x AOL login screen; Suffragist Valentines; Musk x Intuit vs the American people. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Europe takes a big step towards a post-dollar world (permalink) There's a reason every decentralized system eventually finds its way onto a platform: platforms solve real-world problems that platform users struggle to solve for themselves. I've written before about the indie/outsider author Crad Kilodney, who wrote, edited, typeset and published chapbooks of his weird and wonderful fiction, and then sold his books from Toronto street-corners with a sign around his neck reading VERY FAMOUS CANADIAN AUTHOR BUY MY BOOKS (or, if he was feeling spicy, simply: MARGARET ATWOOD): https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/19/crad-kilodney-was-an-outlier/#intermediation Crad was a hell of a writer and a bit of a force of nature, but there are plenty of writers I want to hear from who are never going to publish their own books, much less stand on a street-corner selling them with a MARGARET ATWOOD sign around their necks. Publishers, editors, distributors and booksellers all do important work, allowing writers to get on with their writing, taking all the other parts of the publishing process off their shoulders. That's the value of platforms. The danger of platforms is when they grow so powerful that they usurp the relationship between the parties they are supposed to be facilitating, locking them in and then extracting value from them (someone should coin a word to describe this process!): https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/07/usurpers-helpmeets/#disreintermediation Everyone needs platforms: writers, social media users, people looking for a romantic partner. What's more, the world needs platforms. Say you want to connect all 200+ countries on Earth with high-speed fiber lines; you can run a cable from each country to every other country (about 21,000 cables, many of them expensively draped across the ocean floor), or you can pick one country (preferably one with both Atlantic and Pacific coasts) and run all your cables there, and then interconnect them. That's America, the world's global fiber hub. The problem is, America isn't just a platform for fiber interconnections – it's a Great Power that uses its position at the center of the world's fiber networks to surveil and disrupt the world's communications networks: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden That's a classic enshittification move on a geopolitical scale. It's not the only one America's made, either. Consider the US dollar. The dollar is to global commerce what America's fiber head-ends are to the world's data network: a site of essential, (nominally) neutral interchange that is actually a weapon that the US uses to gain advantage over its allies and to punish its enemies: https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/10/weaponized-interdependence/#the-other-swifties The world's also got about 200 currencies. For parties in one country to trade with those in another country, the buyer needs to possess a currency the seller can readily spend. The problem is that setting up 21,000 pairwise exchange markets from every currency to every other currency is expensive and cumbersome – traders would have to amass reserves of hundreds of rarely used currencies, or they would have to construct long, brittle, expensive, high-risk chains that convert, say, Thai baht into Icelandic kroner to Brazilian reals and finally into Costa Rican colones. Thanks to a bunch of complicated maneuvers following World War II, the world settled on the US dollar as its currency platform. Most important international transactions use \"dollar clearing\" (where goods are priced in USD irrespective of their country of origin) and buyers need only find someone who will convert their currency to dollars in order to buy food, oil, and other essentials. There are two problems with this system. The first is that America has never treated the dollar as a neutral platform; rather, American leaders have found subtle, deniable ways to use \"dollar dominance\" to further America's geopolitical agenda, at the expense of other dollar users (you know, \"enshittification\"). The other problem is that America has become steadily less deniable and subtle in these machinations, finding all kinds of \"exceptional circumstances\" to use the dollar against dollar users: https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/26/difficult-multipolarism/#eurostack America's unabashed dollar weaponization has been getting worse for years, but under Trump, the weaponized dollar has come to constitute an existential risk to the rest of the world, sending them scrambling for alternatives. As November Kelly says, Trump inherited a poker game that was rigged in his favor, but he still flipped over the table because he resents having to pretend to play at all: https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/26/i-dont-want/#your-greenback-dollar Once Trump tried to steal Greenland, it became apparent that the downsides of the dollar far outweigh its upsides. Last month, Christine Lagarde (president of the European Central Bank) made a public announcement on a radio show that Europe \"urgently\" needed to build its own payment system to avoid the American payment duopoly, Visa/Mastercard: https://davekeating.substack.com/p/can-europe-free-itself-from-visamastercard Now, there's plenty of reasons to want to avoid Visa/Mastercard, starting with cost: the companies have raised their prices by more than 40% since the pandemic started (needless to say, updating database entries has not gotten 40% more expensive since 2020). This allows two American companies to impose a tax on the entire global economy, collecting swipe fees and other commissions on $24t worth of the world's transactions every year: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/europe-banks-launching-product-break-101215642.html But there's another reason to get shut of Visa/Mastercard: Trump controls them. He can order them to cut off payment processing for any individual or institution that displeases him. He's already done this to punish the International Criminal Court for issuing a genocide arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu, and against a Brazilian judge for finding against the criminal dictator Jair Bolsonaro (Trump also threatened to have the judge in Bolsonaro's case assassinated). What's more, Visa/Mastercard have a record of billions (trillions?) of retail transactions taking place between non-Americans, which Trump's officials can access for surveillance purposes, or just to conduct commercial espionage to benefit American firms as a loyalty bonus for the companies that buy the most $TRUMP coins. Two days after Lagarde's radio announcement, 13 European countries announced the formation of \"EuroPA,\" an alliance that will facilitate regionwide transactions that bypass American payment processors (as well as Chinese processors like Alipay): https://news.europawire.eu/european-payment-leaders-sign-mou-to-create-a-sovereign-pan-european-interoperable-payments-network/eu-press-release/2026/02/02/15/34/11/168858/ As European Business Magazine points out, EuroPA is the latest in a succession of attempts to build a European payments network: https://europeanbusinessmagazine.com/business/europes-24-trillion-breakup-with-visa-and-mastercard-has-begun/ There's Wero, a 2024 launch from the 16-country European Payments Initiative, which currently boasts 47m users and 1,100 banks in Belgium, France and Germany, who've spent €7.5b through the network: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/europe-banks-launching-product-break-101215642.html Wero launched as a peer-to-peer payment system that used phone numbers as identifiers, but it expanded into retail at the end of last year, with several large retailers (such as Lidl) signing on to accept Wero payments. Last week, Wero announced an alliance with EuroPA, making another 130m people eligible to use the service, which now covers 72% of the EU and Norway. They're rolling out international peer-to-peer payments in 2026, and retail/ecommerce payments in 2027. These successes are all the more notable for the failures they follow, like Monnet (born 2008, died 2012). Even the EPI has been limping along since its founding, only finding a new vigor on the heels of Trump threatening EU member states with military force if he wasn't given Greenland. As EBM writes, earlier efforts to build a regional payment processor foundered due to infighting among national payment processors within the EU, who jealously guarded their own turf and compulsively ratfucked one another. This left Visa/Mastercard as the best (and often sole) means of conducting cross-border commerce. This produced a \"network effect\" for Visa/Mastercard: since so many Europeans had an American credit card in their wallets, European merchants had to support them; and since so many EU merchants supported Visa/Mastercard, Europeans had to carry them in their wallets. Network effects are pernicious, but not insurmountable. The EU is attacking this problem from multiple angles – not just through EuroPA, but also through the creation of the Digital Euro, a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Essentially, this would give any European who signs up an account with the ECB, the federal bank of the Eurozone. Then, using an app or a website, any two Digital Euro customers could transfer funds to one another using the bank's own ledgers, instantaneously and at zero cost. EBM points out that there's a critical difficulty in getting EuroPA off the ground: because it is designed to be cheap to use, it doesn't offer participating banks the windfall profits that Visa/Mastercard enjoy, which might hold back investment in EuroPA infrastructure. But banks are used to making small amounts of money from a lot of people, and with the Digital Euro offering a \"public option,\" the private sector EuroPA system will have a competitor that pushes it to continuously improve its systems. It's true that European payment processing has been slow and halting until now, but that was when European businesses, governments and households could still pretend that the dollar – and the payment processing companies that come along with it – was a neutral platform, and not a geopolitical adversary. If there's one thing the EU has demonstrated over the past three years, it's that geopolitical threats from massive, heavily armed mad empires can break longstanding deadlocks. Remember: Putin's invasion of Ukraine and the end of Russian gas moved the EU's climate goals in ways that beggar belief: the region went from 15 years behind on its solar rollout to ten years ahead of schedule in just a handful of months: https://pluralistic.net/2026/02/05/contingency/#this-too-shall-pass This despite an all-out blitz from the fossil fuel lobby, one of the most powerful bodies in the history of civilization.

      "summary": "My favorite piece of technology in science fiction isn't lightsabers, flying spaceships, or even robots. It's AI. But not just any AI. My favorite is the one in the TV show The Expanse . If you watch The Expanse, the most advanced technology is, of course, the Epstein drive (an unfortunate name in this day and age). In their universe, humanity can travel to distant planets, the Belt, and Mars. Mars has the most high-tech military, which is incredibly cool. But the AI is still what impresses me most. If you watched the show, you're probably wondering what the hell I'm talking about right now. Because there is no mention of AI ever. The AI is barely visible. In fact, it's not visible at all. Most of the time, there aren't even voices. Instead, their computer interfaces respond directly to voice and gesture commands without returning any sass. In Season 1, Miller (the detective) is trying to solve a crime. Out of the blue, he just says, \"Plot the course the Scopuli took over the past months.\" The course is plotted right there in his living room. No fuss, no interruptions, no \"OK Google.\" And when he finally figures it out, no one says \"You are absolutely right!\" He then interacts with the holographic display in real time, asking for additional information and manipulating the data with gestures. At no point does he anthropomorphize the AI. It's always there, always available, always listening, but it never interrupts. This type of interaction is present throughout the series. In the Rocinante, James Holden will give commands like \"seal bulkhead,\" \"plot intercept course,\" or \"scan for life signs,\" and the ship's computer simply executes. There are no loading screens, no chatbot personality trying to be helpful. The computer doesn't explain what it's doing or ask for confirmation on routine tasks. It just works. When Holden needs tactical information during a firefight, he doesn't open an app or navigate menus. He shouts questions, and relevant data appears on his helmet display. When Naomi needs to calculate a complex orbital maneuver, she doesn't fight with an interface. She thinks out loud, and the system provides the calculations she needs. This is the complete opposite of Microsoft's Copilot... Yes, this is about Copilot. In Microsoft's vision, they think they're designing an AI assistant, an AI copilot that's always there to help. You have Copilot in Excel, in Edge, in the taskbar. It's everywhere, yet it's as useless as you can imagine. What is Copilot? Is it ChatGPT or a wrapper around it? Is it a code assistant? Is it a search engine? Or wait, is it all of Microsoft Office now? It's attached to every application, yet it hasn't been particularly helpful. We now use Teams at work, and I see Copilot popping up every time to offer to help me, just like Clippy. OK, fine, I asked for the meaning of a term I hear often in this company. Copilot doesn't know. Well, it doesn't say it doesn't know. Instead, it gives me the definition of what it thinks the term means in general. Imagine for a second you're a manager and you hear developers talking about issues with Apache delaying a project. You don't know what Apache is, so you ask Copilot. It tells you that the Apache are a group of Native American tribes known for their resilience in the Southwest. If you don't know any better, you might take that definition at face value, never knowing that Copilot has does not have access to any of the company data. Now in the project retro, you'll blame a native American tribe for delaying the project. Copilot is everywhere, yet it is nowhere. Nobody deliberately opens it to solve a problem. Instead, it's like Google Plus from back in the day. If you randomly clicked seven times on the web, you would somehow end up with a Google Plus account and, for some reason, two YouTube accounts. Copilot is visible when it should be invisible, and verbose when it should be silent. It interrupts your workflow to offer help you didn't ask for, then fails to provide useful answers when you actually need them. It's the opposite of the AI in The Expanse. It doesn't fade in the background. It is constantly reminding you that you need to use it here and now. In The Expanse , the AI doesn't have a personality because it doesn't need one. It's not trying to be your friend or impress you with its conversational abilities. It's a tool, refined to perfection. It is not trying to replace your job, it is there to support you. Copilot only exists to impress you, and it fails at it every single time. Satya should binge-watch The Expanse. I'm not advocating for AI everything, but I am all for creating useful tools. And Copilot, as it currently exists, is one of the least useful implementations of AI I've encountered. The best technology is invisible. It doesn't announce itself, doesn't demand attention, and doesn't try to be clever. It simply works when you need it and disappears when you don't. I know Microsoft won't read this or learn from it. Instead, I expect Windows 12 to be renamed Microsoft Copilot OS. In The Expanse, the AI turn people into heroes. In our world, Copilot, Gemini, ChatGPT, all want to be the heroes. And they will differentiate themselves by trying to be the loudest.",
